[ biochemical studies on camomile <unk> in vitro studies about the <unk> activity of ( -- ) <unk> ( <unk> transl ) ] .
( -- ) <unk> has a primary <unk> action depending on dosage , which is not caused by an alteration of the <unk> .
the proteolytic activity of pepsin is reduced by 50 percent through addition of <unk> in the ratio of <unk> .
the <unk> action of <unk> only occurs in case of direct contact .
in case of a previous contact with the substrate , the inhibiting effect is lost .
[ demonstration of tumor inhibiting properties of a strongly <unk> <unk> weight <unk> comparative studies with ifosfamide on the <unk> ds <unk> stimulation of the autoimmune activity for <unk> 20 days by ba 1 , a <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> novel prophylactic possibilities ] .
a report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in ba 1 [ <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ] having a ( low ) molecular mass m = <unk> .
experiments in 214 ds <unk> bearing wistar rats have shown that ba 1 , at a dosage of only about 12 percent ld50 ( 150 mg kg ) and negligible lethality ( 1.7 percent ) , results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and , in one test , of 80 percent with hyperglycemia .
under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide ( if ) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent ld50 ( 150 mg kg ) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent .
( contrary to ba 1 , <unk> hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery <unk> ) however this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different ( complementary ) mechanisms of action .
<unk> counts made after application of the said <unk> and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with ba 1 and with ifosfamide , the known suppression in the <unk> interval usually found with standard <unk> .
in combination with the cited plaque test for ba 1 , blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status .
since if can be taken as one of the most efficient <unk> -- there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the ds <unk> in rats -- these findings are of special importance .
finally , the total amount of <unk> and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of <unk> rats after i.v. application of ba 1 .
the thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising .
effect of <unk> on total and regional myocardial blood flow .
the distribution of blood flow to the <unk> , medium and <unk> layers of the left ventricular free wall was studied in anaesthetized dogs under <unk> ( a ) , hypoxic ( b ) conditions and under pharmacologically induced ( <unk> ) coronary vasodilation ( c ) .
regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method .
in <unk> a <unk> gradient of flow was observed , with the <unk> layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the <unk> layers .
in hypoxia induced vasodilation this <unk> gradient of flow was persistent .
in contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation .
the <unk> gradient decreased .
in contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable <unk> capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs .
the differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism .
influence of a new <unk> compound on the induction of enzymes in rat liver .
the <unk> compound n , <unk> [ <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ] <unk> ( <unk> ) was analyzed as to its effect on the induction of <unk> and <unk> in rat liver .
1. the basic activity of the enzymes was not influenced by the substance either in normal or in <unk> animals .
2. the induction of the enzymes by cortisone increased in the presence of the compound whereas the substrate induction remained unchanged .
3. the induction of <unk> by <unk> in tissue culture is inhibited if the dose of compound <unk> is higher than 5 <unk> .
pharmacological properties of new neuroleptic compounds .
rmi 61 140 , rmi 61 144 and rmi 61 280 are newly <unk> <unk> [ <unk> ( b , f ) <unk> ] <unk> which show interesting <unk> effects .
this work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds , in order to demonstrate their <unk> activity in comparison with <unk> ( <unk> ) and chlordiazepoxide ( cpd ) .
the inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone .
the <unk> activity is evidenced by increased <unk> sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed .
our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do <unk> and cpd .
as to the antipsychotic outline , our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong <unk> activity .
they show also an <unk> effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than <unk> .
we have also found extrapyramidal effects , as catalepsy , common to many <unk> of the kind of the standards used by us .
as for vegetative phenomena , the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong , probably due to an <unk> inhibition .
<unk> activity against lethal doses of adrenaline , <unk> and <unk> effects , as well as other actions ( hypothermia , analgesia , etc. ) confirm that rmi 61 140 , rmi 61 144 and rmi 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of <unk> .
studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to <unk> , although with less effect on dopamine level .
[ studies on the action of an anticholinergic agent in combination with a tranquilizer on gastric juice secretion in man ] .
a double-blind study with <unk> comparisons was carried out to investigate the effects of 15 mg of ( <unk> ) <unk> bromide ( <unk> ) <unk> ( sch 1000 ) , 15 mg sch 1000 + 10 mg oxazepam , 10 mg oxazepam and placebo with oral administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume , amount of acid , concentration and ph values in 12 healthy volunteers .
the secretion parameters were measured during a <unk> basal period and a <unk> stimulation period .
the gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube .
stimulation was effected by 1 <unk> <unk> via drip infusion .
the friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation , and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the wilcoxon test ( <unk> rank ) .
the results show that sch 1000 and sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume .
as compared with placebo , it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone .
sch 1000 and sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be <unk> in reducing the amount of basal acid , while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion .
none of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid , although both sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values .
during the basal secretion period , all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration , but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period .
the ph value was <unk> increased only by sch 1000 and sch 1000 + oxazepam , and this even only during the basal period .
the results are discussed .

lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis .
i. <unk> .
seven distinct <unk> ( ec 3.2 ) have been characterized in <unk> epidermis .
their properties indicate them to be of lysosomal origin .
the <unk> ' of the epidermal <unk> is significantly different from that reported for whole skin , the activities of beta-galactosidase and <unk> being very high and those of the remaining enzymes relatively low in epidermis .
lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis .
2. ester hydrolases .
five distinct ester hydrolases ( ec 3-1 ) have been characterized in <unk> epidermis .
these are carboxylic esterase , acid phosphatase , pyrophosphatase , and <unk> a and b .
their properties are consistent with those of lysosomal enzymes .
a serum <unk> property dependent upon <unk> groups .
a serum <unk> reactive with red cells in the presence of <unk> groups is reported .
it is likely that this represents an additional example of the type of <unk> previously described as agglutinating red cells in the absence of ionized calcium .
experimental evidence is presented indicating that it is free <unk> groups that potentiate agglutination and that any metal ion , such as calcium , capable of chelating with these groups will prove to be inhibitory .
effect of human erythrocyte stromata on complement activation .
stroma from either normal or <unk> red cells is capable of inhibiting , to some extent , lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the <unk> test .
the same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from <unk> <unk> obtained from each stroma preparation , suggesting that the same factor could be responsible for both activities .
stromata and peaks also induce lysis of <unk> cells in <unk> serum , indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway .
this is confirmed by <unk> observation .
when serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced .
this would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway .
the possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in pnh patients is discussed .
determinants of intracellular ph in the erythrocyte .
the effect of <unk> upon pentose phosphate pathway activity in normal and <unk> red cells .
the effect of the major metabolite of aspirin , namely salicylic acid , upon the pentose phosphate pathway ( ppp ) of normal and <unk> red cells has been studied .
salicylic acid was shown to inhibit this pathway in proportion to the amount present .
at any concentration of this substance there was greater inhibition of the ppp in <unk> than in normal red cells .
the effects of processing of <unk> supplements on rumen ph , rate of digestion of voluntary intake of dried grass in sheep .
1. in one experiment the effect on rumen ph of feeding with restricted amounts of whole or pelleted barley was studied .
with whole barley there was little variation in rumen ph associated with feeding time , but with pelleted barley the ph decreased from about 7-0 before feeding to about 5-3 , 2 -- 3 h after feeding .
2. the rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the <unk> of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment .
after 24 h incubation only 423 <unk> incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 <unk> incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley .
3. the voluntary intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they received supplements of either 25 or 50 g whole or pelleted <unk> live weight <unk> .
at the high level , pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534 g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg .
the digestibility of <unk> fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to processing .
<unk> the implications of these findings on supplementation of <unk> with cereals are discussed .
poly ( <unk> acid ) : formation of ordered <unk> and interaction with poly ( <unk> acid ) .
poly ( <unk> acid ) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of high stability .
the <unk> group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds between two residues along the `` top '' , or long axis , of the purines .
the usual hydrogen bonding protons and watson-crick pairing sites are not involved in the association .
the bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is <unk> at n ( 7 ) .
poly ( <unk> ) is converted by alkaline titration ( pk = 9.7 ) to a quite different ordered structure , which is the favored form over the range approximately ph 10-11 .
the bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar , tetrameric array of guanine residues , in which the <unk> group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding .
poly ( <unk> ) does not interact with poly ( c ) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
titration to the alkaline plateau , however , permits ready formation of a <unk> watson-crick helix .
in contrast to the monomer <unk> , poly ( <unk> ) does not form a triple helix with poly ( c ) under any conditions .
the properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of a strong tendency of the <unk> group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond , when this possibility is not prevented by high ph .
effect of ph on substrate and inhibitor kinetic constants of human liver alanine aminopeptidase .
evidence for two <unk> active center groups .
the presence of at least two <unk> active center groups has been detected by a study of the effect of ph upon catalysis of hydrolysis of <unk> by human liver alanine aminopeptidase and upon the inhibition of hydrolysis by inhibitors and substrate analogs .
<unk> acid , <unk> , and peptide inhibitors have been found to be competitive inhibitors and are therefore thought to bind the active center .
<unk> was previously shown to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of <unk> substrates ( garner , c. w. , and <unk> , f. j. ( 1975 ) , biochemistry 14 , <unk> ) .
a plot of pkm vs. ph for the substrate <unk> showed that binding decreased below ph 5.9 and above 7.5 , the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in slope .
these points are interpreted as the pka either of substrate <unk> groups or <unk> enzyme active center groups .
similar plots of pkm vs. ph for <unk> ( as substrate ) and pki vs. ph for <unk> and <unk> ( as inhibitors ) gave pairs fo pka values of 5.8 and 7.4 , 6.0 and 7.5 , and 5.7 and 7.5 , respectively .
all the above substrates ( and <unk> ) have pka values near 7.5 ; therefore , the <unk> group with a pka value near 7.5 is possibly this substrate group .
similar plots of pki vs. ph for the inhibitors <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> acid had only one bending point at 7.7 , 7.6 , 7.4 , 6.3 , and 5.9 , respectively .
amino acid inhibitors , <unk> , and <unk> acid have no groups with pka values between 5 and 9 .
these data indicate that there are two active center <unk> groups with pka values of approximately 6.0 and 7.5 which are involved in substrate binding or inhibitory amino acid binding but not in catalysis since vmax was constant at all ph values tested .
formation of transient complexes in the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction .
the reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate ( gl ) with <unk> and <unk> has been studied with <unk> techniques .
the enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme .
the results indicate that the ternary complex ( <unk> ( p ) <unk> ) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex ( <unk> ( p ) <unk> ) .
the identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra .
the binding of the coenzyme to ( <unk> ) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of ( <unk> ( p ) <unk> ) while the dissociation of <unk> ( kg ) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of ( <unk> ( p ) <unk> ) .
the km for glutamate was 20-25 mm in the first reaction and 3 mm in the formation of the stable complex .
the km values were independent of the coenzyme .
the reaction rates with <unk> were approximately 50 % greater than those with <unk> .
furthermore , high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of ( <unk> ) while no substrate inhibition was found with <unk> as coenzyme .
adp enhanced while gtp reduced the rate of ( <unk> ( p ) <unk> ) formation .
the rate of formation of ( <unk> ( p ) <unk> ) was inhibited by adp , while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of gtp were added .
the results show that the higher activity found with <unk> compared to <unk> under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of <unk> to the adp activating site of the enzyme .
moreover , the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of ( <unk> ( p ) <unk> ) as this complex is formed with km of 3 mm glutamate , and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration .
human brain and placental choline acetyltransferase : purification and properties .
choline acetyltransferase ( ec <unk> ) catalyzes the biosynthesis of acetylcholine according to the following chemical equation : acetyl-coa + choline in equilibrium to acetylcholine + coa .
in addition to nervous tissue , primate placenta is the only other animal source which contains appreciable acetylcholine and its biosynthetic enzyme .
human brain caudate nucleus and human placental choline acetyltransferase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using ion-exchange and blue <unk> affinity chromatography .
the molecular weights determined by <unk> <unk> gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis are <unk> plus or minus 3000 .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( <unk> acid ) inhibit the enzyme .
<unk> reverses the inhibition produced by the latter two reagents .
the pka of the group associated with <unk> inhibition is 8.6 plus or minus 0.3 .
a chemically competent <unk> is <unk> by <unk> gel filtration .
the enzymes from the brain and placenta are thus far physically and biochemically indistinguishable .
stabilization of the globular structure of <unk> c by chloride in acidic solvents .
increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification of <unk> c .
analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pk of 2.1 <unk> 0.2 and an intrinsic pk of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation .
analysis of methylated <unk> c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion , most likely a heme propionate residue , is responsible for displacement of the methionine ligand .
addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pk of 1.2 <unk> 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a globular conformation into a random coil .
it is most likely that the second protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself .
chloride is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination position of the heme ion .
such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of <unk> c at ph 0.0 and 25 degrees .
a competitive labeling method for the determination of the chemical properties of solitary functional groups in proteins .
the properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as <unk> of the structure of the protein .
we have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary functional groups in proteins may be determined .
the method may be applied to the side chain of histidine , tyrosine , lysine , and cysteine , as well as to the amino terminus of the protein .
the method , which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [ 3h ] - and [ 14c ] <unk> ( <unk> ) in a <unk> procedure , is rapid and sensitive .
advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a <unk> protein , a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein .
the method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme , <unk> protease , and streptomyces griseus ( s.g. ) trypsin , as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein .
the following parameters were obtained for reaction with <unk> at 20 degrees c in 0.1 n kcl : the histidine of hen <unk> lysozyme , pka of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of <unk> m-1 <unk> ; the histidine of <unk> protease , pka of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of <unk> m-1 <unk> ; the histidine of s.g. trypsin , pka of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of <unk> m-1 <unk> ; the <unk> amino terminus of s.g. trypsin , pka of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of <unk> m-1 <unk> .
in addition , the results obtained provide clues as to the <unk> of these functional groups , and indicate that the proteins studied undergo <unk> conformational changes which affect the microenvironment , and hence the chemical reactivity of these groups .
modification of arginine and lysine in proteins with <unk> .
primary amines react with <unk> at ph 6-9 to form <unk> , <unk> .
the latter compounds readily regenerate the primary amine at low ph or on treatment with hydroxylamine .
guanidine and substituted <unk> react with <unk> to form <unk> <unk> at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 20 than the rate of reaction of <unk> with primary amines .
selective modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be achieved with <unk> .
modification of lysine is favored by reaction at ph 7 or for short reaction times at ph 9 .
selective modification of arginine is achieved by reaction with <unk> for long times at ph 9 , followed by treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine .
the extent of modification of lysine and arginine side chains can readily be measured <unk> .
modification of lysozyme with <unk> at ph 7 results in modification of 3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr .
modification of lysozyme with <unk> at ph 9 results in modification of 4 lysine residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr .
treatment of this modified protein with hydroxylamine regenerated the modified lysine residues but caused no change in the modified arginine residues .
one arginine residue seems to be essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme .
the origin of the alkaline inactivation of <unk> .
above ph 8.5 , <unk> is converted into a form which can not be activated to pepsin on exposure to low ph .
intermediate exposure to neutral ph , however , returns the protein to a form which can be activated .
evidence is presented for a reversible , small conformational change in the molecule , distinct from the unfolding of the protein .
at the same time , the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility , which is precipitated at low ph , where activation is normally seen .
the results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of the <unk> molecule .
titration of the basic <unk> region produced an open form , which can return to the native form at neutral ph , but which is maintained at low ph by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion .
bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase : purification and properties of the enzyme .
a purification procedure is reported for obtaining bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase in high yield and amounts of 100-200 mg .
a key step in the procedure is the use of an affinity gel prepared by coupling <unk> to <unk> .
the purified reductase has a specific activity of about 100 <unk> and is homogeneous as judged by analytical <unk> , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and titration with methotrexate .
the products of the first step of edman degradation indicated a minimum purity of 79 % .
the reductase has a molecular weight of about <unk> on the basis of amino acid composition and <unk> <unk> 300 from equilibrium sedimentation .
it is not inhibited by antiserum to the streptococcus faecium reductase ( isoenzyme 2 ) .
unlike the reductase of many other vertebrate tissues , the bovine enzyme is inhibited by <unk> rather than activated and it has a single ph optimum at both low and high ionic strength .
however , the position of the ph optimum is shifted and the activity increased by increasing ionic strength .
automatic edman degradation has been used to determine 34 of the amino-terminal 37 amino acid residues .
considerable homology exists between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from s. faecium and from escherichia coli .
this strengthens the idea that this region contributes to the structure of the binding site for dihydrofolate .
purification and properties of escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase .
dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 40-fold to apparent homogeneity from a <unk> strain of escherichia coli ( rt 500 ) using a procedure that includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography .
determinations of the molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition , sedimentation velocity , and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave values of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , respectively .
an aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel filtration ; treatment of the aggregate with <unk> or <unk> results in an increase in <unk> activity and a regeneration of the monomer .
also , multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
the unresolved enzyme exhibits two ph optima ( ph 4.5 and ph 7.0 ) with dihydrofolate as a substrate .
highest activities are observed in buffers containing large organic cations .
in 100 mm <unk> chloride ( ph 7 ) , the specific activity is 47 <unk> of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at 30 degrees .
folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single ph optimum of ph 4.5 .
at this ph the km for folate is 16 mum , and the vmax is 1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate .
monovalent cations ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase ; at a given ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation .
divalent cations are more potent inhibitors ; the <unk> of <unk> is 250 mum , as compared to 125 mm for kcl .
anions neither inhibit nor activate the enzyme .
the influence of ph on the interaction of inhibitors with <unk> isomerase and determination of the pka of the <unk> carboxyl group .
ionization effects on the binding of the potential transition state analogues <unk> and <unk> appear to be attributable to the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves , therefore it is unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the active site of <unk> isomerase to explain the influence of changing ph on ki in the neutral range .
the binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing ph in the neutral range .
<unk> sulfate , synthesized as an <unk> reagent for <unk> isomerase , is used to provide an indication of the pka of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme .
previously described <unk> reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters , and their changing state of ionization ( accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site ) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pka of the essential carboxyl group from the ph dependence of the rate of inactivation .
being a strong <unk> acid , <unk> sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pka of the carboxyl group .
<unk> sulfate inactivates <unk> isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier .
from the ph dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast <unk> isomerase , the apparent pka of the <unk> carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 <unk> 0.1 .
<unk> inhibition and <unk> nuclear magnetic resonance studies of renal dipeptidase .
kinetic analyses of <unk> inhibition and <unk> nuclear magnetic resonance at 5.88 mhz were employed to study <unk> interactions with the zinc <unk> , renal dipeptidase .
the <unk> hydrolysis of <unk> exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride , chloride , bromide , iodide , azide , nitrate , or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the divalent anion , sulfate .
competitive inhibition was produced by these anions .
one anion was bound per enzyme molecule , and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site .
cyanide ion produced a much more effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other <unk> , and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule .
an investigation of the effect of ph upon <unk> inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pk of approximately 7.8 .
complete dissociation of this group ( approximately ph 8.4 ) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions .
the <unk> line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 m nacl solutions was 100 times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of <unk> ( ii ) .
the line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the <unk> and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation .
when zinc ion was removed from the <unk> by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the <unk> by cyanide , line broadening was decreased .
treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor , guanosine triphosphate , in the presence of 0.5 m nacl also produced a significant decrease in the <unk> line width .
the <unk> line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing ph through the range ph <unk> .
this <unk> variation with ph appeared to result from the titration of a site on the <unk> with an approximate pk of 7.4 .
temperature studies of <unk> line broadening by the <unk> in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant relaxation mechanism is <unk> in nature .
the interaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with hydrogen peroxide : inactivation of the enzyme .
bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated by hydrogen peroxide .
the rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon the concentrations of both h2o2 and of enzyme , and its second-order rate constant at ph 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 m-1 <unk> .
inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of <unk> on the enzyme , and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region , which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity .
inactivation of the enzyme was <unk> and indicated an essential ionization whose pka was approximately 10.2 .
replacement of h2o by d2o raised this pka but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase , measured at ph 10.0 .
several compounds , including xanthine , urate , formate , and azide , protected the enzyme against inactivation by h2o2 .
alcohols and benzoate , which scavenge hydroxyl radical , did not protect .
compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective .
the data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> , by h2o2 , followed by a <unk> type reaction of the <unk> with additional h2o2 .
this would generate <unk> or its ionized equivalent , <unk> -- , which could then <unk> attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme .
compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant , in competition with the adjacent histidine .
circular dichroism and fluorescence studies of homogeneous antibodies to type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide .
the <unk> circular dichroism ( cd ) of three homogeneous <unk> iii pneumococcal antibodies in the absence and the presence of the specific <unk> ligand was studied .
in addition <unk> and <unk> of h and l chains derived from two of these antibodies were carried out and the cd spectra of bound and free reconstituted igg molecules were measured .
the results indicate that the cd spectra of the native antibodies in the <unk> range are very similar in shape and sign and exhibit a positive band at 285 nm .
the homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited cd spectra very similar in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules are no longer stabilized by <unk> disulfide bonds .
upon addition of the <unk> ligand , a significant decrease in amplitude of the cd spectra ( 18-21 % ) occurred in all three native antibodies and their fab fragments as well as in the homologous recombinant molecules .
no cd spectral changes could be detected upon interaction of the <unk> ligand with the heterologous <unk> .
all homogeneous antibodies studied exhibited fluorescence quenching upon oligosaccharide binding and a blue shift of the emission maximum .
this property allowed the determination of the binding constant of one selected antibody to be made .
taken together , cd and fluorescence spectroscopic data suggest that oligosaccharide ligands induced detectable conformational changes in the fab fragment of the antibody .
conformational changes induced in a homogeneous <unk> iii pneumococcal antibody by oligosaccharides of increasing size .
the circular polarization of luminescence ( cpl ) emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring <unk> structural changes in a homogeneous type iii pneumococcal antibody .
a series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type iii polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed .
<unk> changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested , including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and a <unk> oligomer , the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type iii pneumococcal ( <unk> ) polysaccharide .
when fab ' or f ( ab ' ) 2 fragments were used instead of the antibody igg for binding of <unk> polysaccharide , the extent of conformational changes was decreased .
this suggests interactions between fab and fc portions in the igg molecule and subsequent conformational changes in fc part upon antigen binding .
reduction of <unk> disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the fc part but not the changes observed in the fab part , thus suggesting that the presence of the <unk> disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal cpl changes to occur .
small monovalent ligands , i.e. , the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were capable of inducing cpl changes in the fab part of the antibody molecule as well as cpl changes attributed to the fc portion .
a multivalent ligand containing about 16 sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the fc part , similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen .
evidence of the involvement of a 50s ribosomal protein in several active sites .
the functional role of the bacillus <unk> 50s ribosomal protein <unk> ( probably homologous to the escherichia coli protein l2 ) was examined by chemical modification .
the complex [ <unk> rna ] was <unk> in the presence of rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into 50s ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components .
particles containing <unk> <unk> are defective in several functional assays , including ( 1 ) poly ( u ) <unk> poly ( phe ) synthesis , ( 2 ) <unk> activity , ( 3 ) ability to associate with a [ <unk> ( u ) <unk> ] complex , and ( 4 ) binding of elongation factor g and gtp .
the rates of loss of the partial functional activities during <unk> of <unk> indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring , a faster one , involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues , affecting <unk> and subunit association activities and a slower one affecting <unk> binding .
therefore the protein <unk> has one or more histidine residues which are essential for <unk> and subunit association , and another residue which is essential for <unk> binding .
<unk> may be the ribosomal <unk> protein , or a part of the active site , and may contribute functional groups to the other active sites as well .
the interaction of phospholipase a2 with micellar interfaces .
the role of the n-terminal region .
the localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site ( irs ) in porcine pancreatic phospholipase a2 , required for a specific interaction between the enzyme and organized <unk> interfaces , was investigated by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy , by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the unique trp residue , and by protection experiments against specific <unk> hydrolysis .
using the <unk> <unk> substrate analogues : cnh ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) <unk> ( ch3 ) <unk> ( h , oh ) , it is shown that the rather hydrophobic n-terminal sequence of the enzyme , viz. , <unk> , is directly involved in the interaction with the <unk> interface .
besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process .
at neutral or acidic ph the presence of a salt bridge between the n-terminal <unk> group and a negatively charged side chain <unk> the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces , even in the absence of metal ion .
at alkaline ph , interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of <unk> ( <unk> ) ions .
phospholipase a2 as a probe of phospholipid distribution in erythrocyte membranes .
factors influencing the apparent specificity of the reaction .
the action of snake venom <unk> a2 in intact human erythrocytes was investigated in detail .
the basis phospholipase from agkistrodon halys <unk> was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell hemolysis under certain experimental conditions .
the hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events : ( a ) hydrolysis of 70 % of the total cell ph <unk> without any evident hemolysis ; and ( b ) complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine , followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis , attack on the phosphatidylserine .
at ph 7.4 and 10 mm <unk> only stage ( a ) occurred .
however , a slight elevation of the ph of incubation to ph 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mm <unk> in the reaction mixture caused both events ( a ) and ( b ) to occur .
the addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage ( a ) under any reaction conditions .
an investigation showed that <unk> induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular atp levels were lowered .
data are presented which suggest that stage ( b ) is mediated by in influx of <unk> into the cell when the levels of atp are low .
interestingly the <unk> from naja naja venom ( pakistan ) yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from agkistrodon venom .
however , the enzyme from crotalus <unk> and the acidic enzyme also present in the agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied .
other species of erythrocytes , e.g. , guinea pig , monkey , pig , and rat , were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells .
pig , monkey , and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis .
it is evident that the use of these <unk> to probe the localization of <unk> in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution .
certain facets of this problem are discussed .
subunit interactions in yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase .
the spontaneous inactivation of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to fit a simple two-state model at ph 8.5 and 25 degrees .
the first step is a relatively rapid dissociation of the tetramer to dimers with the equilibrium largely in favor of the tetramer .
in the absence of <unk> the dimer inactivates irreversibly .
the <unk> is quite stable with a half-life for complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration .
<unk> of the protein structure ( by ph , ionic strength , and specific salts ) , which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule , result in an alteration of the cooperativity of <unk> binding , the reactivity of the <unk> sulfhydryl group , and the catalytic activity of the enzyme .
covalent modification of two of the four <unk> sulfhydryl groups has profound effects on the <unk> activity which are mediated by changes in the subunit interactions .
sedimentation analysis and hybridization studies indicate that the interaction between subunits remains strong after covalent modification .
under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a tetramer .
equilibrium dialysis studies of <unk> binding to the enzyme at ph 8.5 and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern .
a model consistent with these observations and the observed <unk> reactivity is that of ligand induced sequential conformational changes which are transferred across strongly interacting subunit domains .
methods for distinguishing negatively cooperative binding patterns from mixtures of denatured enzyme and multiple species are discussed .
kinetic light scattering studies on the dissociation of hemoglobin from <unk> terrestris .
the kinetics of the <unk> dissociation of the 3 x 10 ( 6 ) mol wt hemoglobin from <unk> terrestris ( the earthworm ) have been studied in a <unk> <unk> apparatus .
the ligand dependent dissociation data were fit well by a simple sequential model .
the data for co and <unk> are consistent with <unk> leads to <unk> leads to <unk> .
methemoglobin at ph 7 appears to be <unk> and the dissociation is consistent with the model : <unk> leads to <unk> .
in a sequential decay scheme for which <unk> changes are monitored , the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species .
assignment of the <unk> intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates .
this assignment is further supported by the following : ( 1 ) the same model will fit the data for <unk> and <unk> at all three temperatures ( a <unk> variation in rate constants ) , ( 2 ) evidence from electron microscopy shows <unk> forms , and ( 3 ) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at ph 7 .
when co replaces o2 as the ligand , the dissociation rate increases by a factor of four .
the met is about 20 times faster than the initial <unk> dissociation rate , but perhaps more relevant for comparing dissociation of the hexamer , the met rate was respectively 100 times and 500 times faster than that for the assumed <unk> forms of <unk> and <unk> .
the activation energies for the <unk> to hexamer dissociation and for the dissociation of the hexamer to smaller forms were about 30 kcal/mol for <unk> , <unk> , and methemoglobin .
the reversible reduction of horse <unk> by the iron ( ii ) complex of <unk> , n , n , <unk> .
the reduction of <unk> by the iron ( ii ) complex of <unk> , n , <unk> ( <unk> ) has been investigated .
the equilibrium constant , measured <unk> , is 0.21 with a resulting reduction potential of 0.050 v for <unk> .
the rate constant for the reduction is 28 m-1 <unk> with a <unk> <unk> of 13 kcal m-1 and deltas <unk> of -11 eu .
both <unk> and <unk> inhibit the reduction because of the relatively low reactivity of <unk> ( <unk> ) and ionized <unk> ( <unk> ) .
the rate constant for the reduction of <unk> by <unk> is 4.0 x 10 ( -2 ) m-1 <unk> and that for reduction of <unk> is 4.8 m-1 <unk> .
the nitric oxide complex of <unk> is reduced with a rate constant of 10 m-1 <unk> .
the kinetics of oxidation of <unk> by <unk> were studied .
the data are consistent with a mechanism where oxidation takes place entirely through the <unk> form .
a rate constant of 1.45 x 10 ( 2 ) m-1 <unk> was calculated for the oxidation of <unk> by <unk> , in equilibrium constant and rate constant for reduction .
the above data are discussed in terms of a simple <unk> reduction reaction .
constitution and properties of axonal membranes of crustacean nerves .
the purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in [ 3h ] tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in <unk> , <unk> activity .
a characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of <unk> membranes .
the axonal membrane contains <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> proteins .
it also contains <unk> , <unk> and acetylcholinesterase .
the molecular weights of these two enzymes after <unk> are 280,000 and 270,000 , respectively .
the molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for atpase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase .
we confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find [ 3h ] nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes .
the binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel , has been studied in detail .
the dissociation constant for the binding of [ 3h ] tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nm at ph 7.4 .
the concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 <unk> of membrane protein , 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase , 30 times less than the <unk> , <unk> , and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane .
a reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane .
<unk> , which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability , binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane .
[ 3h ] <unk> binding to membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect .
<unk> and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites .
although tetrodotoxin can <unk> the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by <unk> , <unk> does not affect the binding of [ 3h ] tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes .
similarly , tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [ 3h ] <unk> to axonal membranes .
scorpion neurotoxin i , a presynaptic toxin which affects both the <unk> and the <unk> channels , does not interfere with the binding of [ 3h ] tetrodotoxin or [ 3h ] <unk> to axonal membranes .
tetrodotoxin , <unk> , and scorpion neurotoxin i , which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of the sodium channel , act upon three different types of receptor sites .
regulation of nitrogen fixation .
<unk> mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae .
1. a new procedure is described for selecting <unk> mutants based on the method of brenchley et al. ( brenchley , j.e. , <unk> , m.j. and <unk> , b. ( 1973 ) j. <unk> <unk> 248 , <unk> ) for isolating <unk> mutants of a <unk> bacterium .
2. nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of <unk> were as high as 100 % of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of <unk> .
3. biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation ( nif ) <unk> mutants reveals that they fall into three classes .
three mutants ( strains <unk> , 28 and 29 ) , requiring glutamate for growth , synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively ( in the presence of <unk> ) .
a second class of mutants ( strains <unk> and 37 ) requiring glutamine for growth produces <unk> levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein , as determined immunologically .
a third class of <unk> , <unk> mutants ( strain <unk> and 26 ) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically <unk> glutamine synthetase protein .
<unk> <unk> complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains <unk> , 26 , 27 , 37 map in a segment of the klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase .
since the mutant strains <unk> and <unk> produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein , it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene .
the reaction between the superoxide anion radical and cytochrome c .
1. the superoxide anion radical ( <unk> ) reacts with <unk> c to form <unk> c .
no intermediate complexes are observable .
no reaction could be detected between <unk> and <unk> c. 2 .
at 20 degrees c the rate constant for the reaction at ph 4.7 to 6.7 is <unk> ( 6 ) m-1 .
s -1 and as the ph increases above 6.7 the rate constant steadily decreases .
the dependence on ph is the same for tuna heart and horse heart cytochrome c .
no reaction could be demonstrated between <unk> and the form of cytochrome c which exists above ph approximately 9.2 .
the dependence of the rate constant on ph can be explained if cytochrome c has pks of 7.45 and 9.2 , and <unk> reacts with the form present below ph 7.45 with k = <unk> ( 6 ) m-1 - s-1 , the form above ph 7.45 with k = <unk> 10 ( 5 ) m-1 - s-1 , and the form present above ph 9.2 with k = 0 .
3. the reaction has an activation energy of 20 kj <unk> and an enthalpy of activation at 25 degrees c of 18 kj <unk> both above and below ph 7.45 .
it is suggested that <unk> may reduce cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids , and that little protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the activated complex .
<unk> no reduction of <unk> c by <unk> radicals could be demonstrated at ph <unk> but at ph 5.3 , <unk> radicals oxidize <unk> c with a rate constant of about 5-10 ( 5 ) <unk> ( 6 ) m-1 - s-1 .
identification of the 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence in spinach chloroplasts and <unk> particles as the intrinsic back reaction .
the dependence of the level of this phase on the thylakoids internal ph .
after a 500 mus laser flash a 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence is visible under a variety of circumstances in spinach chloroplasts and <unk> particles enriched in photosystem ii prepared by means of <unk> .
the level of this phase is high in the case of inhibition of oxygen evolution at the donor side of photosystem ii .
comparison with the results of babcock and sauer ( 1975 ) <unk> .
<unk> .
acta 376 , <unk> , indicates that their epr signal iif which they suppose to be due to <unk> , the oxidized first secondary donor of photosystem ii , is well correlated with a large amplitude of our 120 mus phase .
we explain our 120 mus phase by the intrinsic back reaction of the excited reaction center in the presence of <unk> , as predicted by van gorkom and donze ( 1973 ) <unk> .
<unk> .
17 , <unk> .
the redox state of <unk> is dependent on the internal ph of the thylakoids .
the results on the effect of ph in the mus region are compared with those obtained in the ms region .
<unk> changes of absorbance and electron spin resonance in small photosystem ii particles .
photosystem ii reaction center components have been studied in small system ii particles prepared with <unk> .
upon illumination the reduction of the primary acceptor was indicated by absorbance changes due to the reduction of a <unk> to the <unk> anion and by a small blue shifts of absorption bands near 545 nm ( <unk> ) and 685 nm .
the <unk> to chlorophyll ratio was between 1/20 and <unk> in various preparations .
the terminal electron donor in this reaction did not cause large absorbance changes but its oxidized form was revealed by a hitherto unknown electron spin resonance ( esr ) signal , which had some properties of the well-known signal ii but a linewidth and <unk> much nearer to those of signal i .
upon darkening absorbance and esr changes decayed together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by <unk> ( 3,4 <unk> ) <unk> .
the donor could be oxidized by ferricyanide in the dark .
illumination in the presence of ferricyanide induced absorbance and esr changes , rapidly reversed upon darkening , which may be ascribed to the oxidation of a chlorophyll a dimer , possibly the primary electron donor of photosystem ii .
in addition an esr signal with 15 to 20 gauss linewidth and a slower dark decay was observed , which may have been caused by a secondary donor .
<unk> reactions of fatty acid hydroperoxides in extracts of potato tuber .
ii .
conversion of <unk> and <unk> acids to <unk> acid , <unk> and <unk> acid derivatives .
1. crude extracts and partially purified enzyme preparations from potato tubers catalyse , at ph 5-7 , the conversion of linoleic acid hydroperoxides to a range of oxygenated fatty acid derivatives .
2. <unk> and <unk> isomers are converted at similar rates to equivalent ( isomeric ) products .
3. the major products from the <unk> isomer were identified as the corresponding <unk> acid derivative , <unk> acid and <unk> acid .
the corresponding products from the <unk> were the <unk> acid , <unk> acid and <unk> acid .
<unk> no separation of activities forming the different products was achieved by partial purification of enzyme extracts .
5. product formation was unaffected by edta , <unk> , <unk> reagents or glutathione but was reduced by boiling the extracts .
<unk> this system is compared with the <unk> <unk> formation of <unk> ether derivatives by potato extracts .
partial purification and properties of microsomal <unk> phosphohydrolase from rat liver .
microsomal <unk> phosphohydrolase ( <unk> phosphatase ec <unk> ) was <unk> and fractionated to yield at least two distinct enzymatically active fractions .
one , denoted fa , was non-specific , had a relatively high km for <unk> acid and was insensitive to inhibition by diacylglycerol .
the second fraction , fb , was specific for <unk> , had a low km , and was inhibited , <unk> , by diacylglycerol .
fa exhibited a sigmoid <unk> curve .
the isolated fb aggregated to particles of about 10 ( 6 ) in the absence of salts and could be dissociated by the addition of monovalent cations at ionic strength <unk> to about 2-10 ( 5 ) daltons and thereby doubled its activity .
dissociation was <unk> and temperature-dependent .
<unk> was inhibitory .
divalent ions were not required for the activity of fa or fb and inhibited at concentrations exceeding 1 mm .
bile acids .
xlvii .
<unk> of precursors of allo bile acids by rabbit liver <unk> .
rabbit liver microsomal preparations fortified with 0.1 mm nadph effectively promote hydroxylation of [ <unk> ] - or [ <unk> ] <unk> acid or [ <unk> ] <unk> to their respective <unk> derivatives in yields of about 25 or 65 % in 60 min .
minor amounts of other products are formed from the diol .
the requirements for activity of rabbit liver microsomal <unk> resemble those of rat liver <unk> .
of a number of enzyme inhibitors studied only <unk> demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit the reaction with either <unk> substrate .
there was no difference in the quantity of product produced from the <unk> acid or the <unk> acid .
no clear sex difference was found in activity of the enzyme , nor was an appreciable difference noted in activity of the enzyme between mature and immature animals .
partial purification and properties of a <unk> aldehyde dehydrogenase of rat liver .
properties of the phenobarbital induced cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ec <unk> ) have been studied in rat liver .
<unk> higher levels were seen in the cytoplasmic activities after phenobarbital treatment in reactor compared to <unk> animals with high concentrations of acetaldehyde ( 18 mm ) and <unk> ( 9 mm ) .
no difference was found with 0.12 mm acetaldehyde , 2 mm glycolaldehyde , 6 mm formaldehyde or 0.5 mm betaine aldehyde .
the reactor group also had slightly higher activity in the mitochondrial fraction with the high acetaldehyde and <unk> concentrations .
in the microsomal fraction , the activities showed no differences at any substrate concentration .
an induced aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified <unk> by chromatographic techniques .
it had different molecular and <unk> properties than the main <unk> enzyme normally present in rat liver cytoplasm .
the pi of the induced enzyme was about 7.0 as measured by isoelectric focusing .
it was active with several aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes but not with formaldehyde , glycolaldehyde or <unk> .
the <unk> for <unk> and acetaldehyde were in the <unk> range .
<unk> concentrations of aromatic aldehydes caused a strong substrate inhibition .
the enzyme was inhibited by <unk> concentrations of disulfiram .
estrone , <unk> , progesterone and diethylstilbestrol also affected the enzyme activity .
<unk> from plant tissues .
vi .
preliminary characterization of enzymes from solanum melongena l. and zea mays l .
enzymes capable of hydrolyzing esters of <unk> have been assayed in extracts of solanum melongena l .
( eggplant ) and zea mays l .
( corn ) .
the enzymes from both species are inhibited by the <unk> <unk> , physostigmine , and <unk> and by <unk> , a plant growth retardant and they both have ph optima near ph 8.0 .
the enzyme from eggplant is maximally active at a substrate concentration of 0.15 mm <unk> and is inhibited at higher substrate concentrations .
on the basis of this last property , the magnitude of inhibition by the various inhibitors , and the substrate specificity , we conclude that the enzyme from eggplant , but not that from corn , is a cholinesterase .
behavior of soluble and immobilized acid phosphatase in <unk> media .
the hydrolysis of <unk> phosphate by wheat germ acid phosphatase ( <unk> monoester phosphohydrolase , ec <unk> ) has been investigated in mixtures of aqueous buffers with acetone , dioxane and acetonitrile .
the enzyme was either in free solution or immobilized on a <unk> support which consisted of a porous carbonaceous layer on solid glass beads .
the highest enzyme activity was obtained in acetone and acetonitrile mixed with citrate buffer over a wide range of organic solvent concentration .
in 50 % ( v/v ) acetone both v and km of the immobilized enzyme were about half of the values in the neat aqueous buffer , but the ki for inorganic phosphate was unchanged .
in 50 % ( v/v ) mixtures of various solvents and citrate buffers of different ph , the <unk> activity was found to depend on the ph of the aqueous buffer component rather than the ph of the <unk> mixture as measured with the <unk> electrode .
the relatively high rates of <unk> liberation in the presence of glucose even at high organic solvent concentrations suggest that <unk> is facilitated at low water activity .
purification and some enzymatic properties of the <unk> from bacillus r-4 which <unk> rhizopus cell walls .
a strain of bacillus sp ( bacillus r-4 ) produces a protease and a <unk> both of which have the ability to lyse rhizopus cell walls .
of the enzymes , the <unk> has been purified to an <unk> and <unk> homogeneous state , and identified as a <unk> .
the enzyme was active on glycol chitosan as well as chitosan .
molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated as 31 000 and isoelectric point as ph 8.30 .
the enzyme was most active at ph 5.6 and at 40 degrees c with either rhizopus cell wall or glycol chitosan as substrate , and was stable over a range of ph 4.5 to 7.5 at 40 degrees c for 3 h .
the activity was lost by sulfhydryl reagents and restored by either reduced glutathione of l-cysteine .
an abrupt decrease in viscosity of the reaction mixture suggested an <unk> cleavage of chitosan by this enzyme .
specificity studies on <unk> using oligosaccharides from <unk> urine as substrates .
oligosaccharides containing terminal <unk> alpha ( 1 leads to 2 ) - , alpha ( 1 leads to 3 ) - , and alpha ( 1 leads to 6 ) <unk> mannose residues , isolated from human and bovine <unk> <unk> were used as substrates to test the specificities of acidic <unk> isolated from human and bovine liver .
the enzymes released all the <unk> mannose residues from each oligosaccharide and were most effective on the smallest substrate .
enzyme a in each case was less active on the oligosaccharides than <unk> b2 , even though the apparent km value for the substrates was the same with each enzyme .
the human acidic <unk> were also found to be more active on substrates isolated from human rather than bovine <unk> urine .
human <unk> c , which has a neutral ph optimum when assayed with a synthetic substrate , did not hydrolyse any of the oligosaccharides at neutral ph , but was found to be active at an acidic ph .
<unk> adenosine <unk> in the microsomal fraction of tooth germ from porcine fetus .
the characterization and localization of a ca ( <unk> ) <unk> ( atp phosphohydrolase , ec <unk> ) in the tooth germ of the porcine fetus are reported .
this enzyme , a <unk> fraction , is preferentially activated by ca ( <unk> ) .
in the presence of 0.5 mm atp , maximal enzyme activity is obtained at 0.5 -- 1.0 mm <unk> .
the maximal rate of atp hydrolysis is <unk> 20 <unk> per h per mg of protein as the enzyme preparation is used here .
at optimal ca ( <unk> ) concentration , the mg ( <unk> ) has an inhibitory effect .
the enzyme does not require <unk> or/and <unk> for activation by ca ( <unk> ) .
other nucleotide <unk> may serve as the substrate , but v for atp is the highest .
the km for atp is 8.85 - 10 ( -5 ) m .
the optimal ph for ca ( <unk> ) activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2 .
well known inhibitors of ( <unk> + <unk> ) <unk> , mitochondria atpase and ca ( <unk> ) <unk> in the <unk> do not inhibit the enzyme .
in the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction containing cell and golgi body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an <unk> layer , stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum .
preparation and characterization of an enzymatically active immobilized derivative of myosin .
purified skeletal muscle myosin ( ec <unk> ) has been covalently bound to <unk> 4b by the cyanogen bromide procedure .
the resulting complex , <unk> , possesses adenosine <unk> activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time .
under optimal binding conditions , approximately 33 % of the specific atpase activity of the bound myosin is retained .
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured <unk> indicates that 85 % of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains , in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of <unk> subunits .
the adenosine <unk> of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying ph , ionic strength , and cation concentration .
the atpase profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin , however subtle differences are found .
the <unk> atpase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent km is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin .
these differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site ( s ) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix .
radioactive labeling and location of specific thiol groups in myosin from fast , slow and cardiac muscles .
1. based on incorporation of radioactively labeled <unk> , the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin ( ec <unk> ) from fast , slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into 3 types .
all 3 <unk> contain 2 <unk> , 2 <unk> and a variable number of <unk> groups per molecule .
both <unk> and <unk> groups which are essential for functioning of the <unk> atpase , are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types .
2. the variation in the incorporation pattern of <unk> over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of mg ( <unk> ) - atp hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized .
in all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of mg ( <unk> ) - atp was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees c .
in all three cases , this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by <unk> temperature .
3. using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains , their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light <unk> : light <unk> : light <unk> per molecule of fast myosin , 2.0 : 1.9 for light <unk> : light <unk> per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light <unk> : light <unk> per molecule of cardiac myosin .
this qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated <unk> , but rather seems to be connected with their respective <unk> atpase activities .
yeast glutathione reductase .
studies of the kinetics and stability of the enzyme as a function of ph and salt concentration .
1. the ph dependencies of the apparent michaelis constant for oxidized glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase ( ec <unk> ) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mm nadph in the range ph 4.5 -- 8.0 .
between ph 5.5 and 7.6 , both of these parameters are relatively constant .
the principal effect of low ph on the kinetics of the <unk> reaction is the observation of a <unk> substrate inhibition by oxidized glutathione at ph less than or equal 7 , which is shown to correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the enzyme .
2. the catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at ph 5.5 is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration .
the stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at ph 5.5 and 25 degrees c in the absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate concentration .
the results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme .
in contrast , inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme .
characteristics of the dephosphorylated form of phosphorylase purified from rat liver and measurement of its activity in crude liver preparations .
the phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase ( <unk> : orthophosphate <unk> , ec <unk> ) ( phosphorylase a ) is active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form ( phosphorylase b ) , in contrast to the muscle enzyme , has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of amp .
we have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each .
phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions .
the phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate , and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate , and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase .
substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor ( km glycogen = 2.5 mm , <unk> = 250 mm ) compared to phosphorylase a ( km glycogen = 1.8 mm , km <unk> = 0.7 mm ) .
liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of amp .
however , amp lowered the km for <unk> to 80 mm for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mm for the enzyme in crude extract ( ka = 0.5 mm ) .
using appropriate substrate , buffer and amp concentrations , assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90 % of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts .
interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo ( under acute stimulation ) and in vitro with little change in total activity .
a decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes .
multiple forms of casein kinase from rabbit erythrocytes .
two rabbit erythrocyte casein kinases , gtp : casein kinase i and gtp : casein kinase ii , have been purified 29 <unk> and 47 <unk> , respectively .
studies employing sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase i has a molecular weight of about 9.5 - 10 ( 5 ) ( 25 s ) and kinase ii about 1.4 - 10 ( 6 ) ( 32 s ) .
these enzymes can utilize either atp or gtp as the phosphoryl donor .
among various protein substrates examined , these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein greater than 50 % dephosphorylated <unk> congruent to 50 % dephosphorylated casein greater than <unk> .
histones , <unk> and bovine serum albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors .
kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by nacl .
both phosphotransferases require mg ( <unk> ) for activity and are optimally active at ph 9.0 .
the enzymes have apparent km values of 2.5 - 10 ( -5 ) m for gtp , 2 - 10 ( -5 ) m for atp , and 0.4 -- 0.6 mg/ml for casein .
the incorporation of the terminal phosphate of gtp into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to varying degrees by atp , itp , adp , and gdp but not by utp , ctp , gmp , adenosine <unk> monophosphate , and guanosine <unk> monophosphate .
in addition , naf and <unk> acid are also found to inhibit the activity of both kinases .
the effect of <unk> is interesting and suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the casein kinases in the red blood cells .
kinetic studies and effects of anions on creatine <unk> from skeletal muscle of rhesus monkey ( macaca mulatta ) .
a purification procedure for creatine kinase ( ec <unk> ) from muscle of the <unk> -- 170 <unk> <unk> protein per min at 30 degrees c and a yield of <unk> 0.5 g/kg muscle .
assuming equilibrium kinetics , synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions .
kinetic constants for the binding of each substrate to the free enzyme and the <unk> substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for the enzyme from other species .
inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products .
so4 ( <unk> ) inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group .
inhibition by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar <unk> complex .
these anions stabilize the dead-end complex , <unk> , which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group .
the effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the <unk> complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis .
the dead-end complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group against inhibition by <unk> .
addition of <unk> or <unk> to the dead-end complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection .
the essential thiol group is inhibited by <unk> at a rate which is essentially independent of ph over the normal stability range of the enzyme .
contrary to our previous report this ph independence is not altered by the presence of dead-end complex , creatine plus <unk> , in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture .
it is inferred that the <unk> ' thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same properties as that of the rabbit enzyme .
in consequence , the inferences made about the role of this group based on our previous work on the monkey enzyme are no longer valid .
the present findings are compatible with the essential thiol group playing a conformational role in the catalytic process .
studies on rat renal cortical cell kallikrein .
i. separation and measurement .
a technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension .
after rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats , viable , counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained .
cells were suspended in a <unk> buffer containing 0.5 % <unk> , homogenized , centrifuged , <unk> , and gel filtered on <unk> <unk> .
column chromatography on <unk> resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 m <unk> phosphate buffer .
subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine , insofar as ph optimum , effects of inhibitors , bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned .
calculated yields were about 70 % of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell <unk> .
recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell <unk> , the <unk> columns , or the <unk> from the columns ranged from <unk> % ( mean 96 % ) .
using this technique , it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in <unk> renal cortical cells ranged from <unk> ( -2 ) to 4.6 - 10 ( -2 ) <unk> methyl ester ( <unk> ) esterase units per 10 ( 8 ) cells .
however , cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 37 degrees c for 3-8 h contained no measurable kallikrein activity , whereas the surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone .
studies on electron transfer between mercury electrode and <unk> .
the electrochemical behaviour of <unk> c , <unk> and methemoglobin was studied using d.c. , a.c. and differential pulse <unk> , and controlled potential electrolysis .
1. the three <unk> yield d.c. <unk> steps , and peaks in differential pulse <unk> , the height of which is proportional to concentration .
the charge transfer is influenced by strong adsorption .
2. the concentration dependence of the a.c. <unk> indicates structural changes in the adsorbed molecules .
3. the reduction products of controlled potential electrolysis of <unk> and methemoglobin have absorption spectra identical with the native control samples .
the affinity for oxygen and the cooperativity in hemoglobin are not affected by the reaction at the electrode .
<unk> the charge transfer proceeds via adsorbed , already reduced , molecules to freely <unk> proteins .
the binding of organic phosphates to human <unk> a .
perturbation of the polymerization of proteins by effectors .
theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium .
the problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding sites and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states .
it is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent .
particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which binding sites are not conserved ( and binding affinities are altered ) on polymer formation .
the latter type of system is exemplified by studies on <unk> a in 0.25 m sodium acetate , ph 5.4 .
in the absence of added organic phosphate effectors , a <unk> equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of 4.15 <unk> 0.06 x 10 ( 3 ) <unk> , determined from sedimentation equilibrium results .
correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine <unk> ( atp ) results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric ( alpha beta ) and tetrameric ( alpha beta ) 2 species with intrinsic binding constants <unk> ( 3 ) <unk> ( 3 ) and <unk> ( 4 ) <unk> ( 4 ) <unk> , respectively .
it is also shown that <unk> perturbs the <unk> equilibrium in a similar way to atp .
n-terminal spin label studies of hemoglobin , ligand and ph dependence .
human hemoglobin was spin labeled with <unk> , which is known to bind specifically to the n-terminal <unk> groups of proteins and slightly to the reactive sulfhydryl groups .
electron spin resonance ( esr ) analysis indicated a partially resolved <unk> spectrum , suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites .
using specific blocking reagents prior to spin labeling , the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of <unk> ( immobile ) and the <unk> group of the n-terminal <unk> ( mobile ) .
the relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and ph , while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters , e.g. the <unk> n-terminal ends of <unk> have restricted motion at all ph ranges studied , while those of <unk> are relatively free to move at the basic ph range , but become more restricted in the acidic ph range .
the behavior of <unk> and <unk> of bovine superoxide dismutase at low ph .
1. <unk> dismutase from bovine erythrocytes has been shown to undergo a reversible structural modification in the ph 3-5 range .
2. the spectral alterations observed on changing from neutrality to ph 2 were : a slight attenuation of the 680 nm absorbance ; the loss of the 450 nm shoulder , apparent in the optical spectrum of the native protein ; and a new band appeared at 330 nm .
the circular dichroism at 600 nm was essentially lost while a weak negative band appeared at <unk> 380 nm and a positive band at 310 <unk> 3 .
the epr spectrum was also modified on changing from the native to the low ph form : a parallel increased from approximately 130 to approximately 150 g , g parallel remained unchanged at approximately 2.27 , and gm decreased from approximately 2.09 to approximately 2.08 .
the apparent linewidth remained essentially constant .
<unk> high resolution ( 220 mhz ) pmr spectra of <unk> and <unk> revealed that the metals influence the three-dimensional structure of the protein .
5. pmr studies indicated that at ph 3 the <unk> existed almost entirely in a random coil form and that it assumed a compact well-ordered structure on returning to neutral ph .
the <unk> maintained a compact , apparently dimeric , structure even at ph 3 .
mechanical precipitation of hemoglobin koln .
hb koln ( beta 98 val leads to met ) was found to precipitate rapidly during mechanical shaking .
the rate of precipitation of hb koln is 5-6 times faster than that of hb s .
the kinetics of precipitation of the <unk> <unk> , which is a mixture of hb koln and hb a , showed a biphasic curve indicating that hb koln precipitates independently from hb a .
the instability of hb koln may be attributed to the conformational change in the vicinity of heme .
the mechanical shaking may be used as a new method for detection and quantitation of hemoglobin koln and other unstable hemoglobins .
physical properties and subunits of <unk> grandis <unk> .
the <unk> of the leech <unk> grandis possessed an s20 , w of 57 s at neutral ph , its isoelectric point at ph 6.0 and exhibited a slightly sigmoid oxygenation curve with n approximately 2.1 and p50 = 11.2 mm at ph 7.4 .
a minimum molecular weight of <unk> <unk> 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents , 0.22 <unk> 0.01 and 2.73 <unk> 0.14 weight % , respectively .
the subunit composition of the <unk> was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral ph .
<unk> <unk> dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits ( 1 through 4 ) possessing molecular weights of about 27000 , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , respectively .
when the <unk> was reduced with <unk> prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis , three subunits were observed , possessing molecular weights of about 13000 ( i ) , <unk> ( ii ) and 28000 ( iii ) .
sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit i was provided by subunits 1 and 4 , subunit ii was provided by subunit 1 and subunit iii was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3 .
<unk> <unk> thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains .
it is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group .
the shape of the <unk> <unk> observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid <unk> and <unk> .
myosin from arterial smooth muscle : isolation following actin depolymerization .
the contractile proteins from arterial smooth muscle are highly soluble , and can be extracted at i = 0.05 .
however , they can be precipitated by a prolonged dialysis at ph 6 to give an <unk> with a high , although variable , actin : myosin ratio .
the sedimentation behavior of this <unk> at high ionic strength was examined as a function of ph , protein concentration and composition by preparative <unk> .
comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle <unk> of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the behaviors of these two systems .
it was found that much smooth muscle <unk> is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions , and that it sediments at a slower rate than f-actin .
the solubility of the supernatant protein ( a <unk> <unk> ) in 0.2 m k cl ( ph 7 ) depended on the ph during centrifugation .
a lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin concentration in the supernatant , suggesting a dependence on actin <unk> .
pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant by polyethylene <unk> , but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic strength .
the solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from striated muscles .
a relationship between the presence of <unk> actin and the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested .
hybrids of chemical derivatives of escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase .
the activities of hybrid dimers of alkaline phosphatase containing two chemically modified subunits have been investigated .
one hybrid species was prepared by dissociation and reconstitution of a mixture of two variants produced by chemical modification of the native enzyme with succinic anhydride and <unk> , respectively .
the <unk> hybrid was separated from the other members of the hybrid set by <unk> chromatography and then converted to a <unk> hybrid by reduction of the modified tyrosine residues with sodium dithionite .
a comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with the activities of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> derivatives has shown that either the subunits of alkaline phosphatase function independently or if the subunits turnover alternately in a reciprocating mechanism , then the intrinsic activity of each subunit must be strongly dependent on its partner subunit .
some physicochemical properties of <unk> ( <unk> <unk> replaced by arg ( g9 ) <unk> ) .
<unk> was discovered in 1970 [ 1 ] in a canadian family of british origin .
recently we observed the same variant in a second family , and found that the <unk> of <unk> is slightly unstable at 65 degrees c , dissociates less readily at alkaline ph than does <unk> , and forms asymmetric hybrids with other hemoglobins which are readily detectable by electrophoresis .
the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin tak , a variant with an elongated beta chain .
the oxygen affinity was investigated of purified hb tak , a human haemoglobin variant with elongated <unk> .
a very low p50 value was found which was not influenced by the addition of 2,3 <unk> .
the n value was 1 , indicating <unk> .
the oxygen equilibrium curve of the whole blood <unk> containing hbs a and tak was close to that of hb a at the top of the curve , while the bottom of the curve greatly deviated from the latter , indicative of small if any interaction between hb a and tak during oxygenation .
effects of membrane ribonuclease and <unk> on the digestion of <unk> acid by rat liver plasma membrane .
1. fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease activity which at ph 7.8 in the presence of 10 mm edta can digest <unk> acid ( poly ( u ) ) and <unk> acid ( poly ( c ) ) but not <unk> acid ( poly ( a ) ) and <unk> acid ( poly ( g ) ) .
under these conditions , the membrane preparation does not degrade native or denatured dna .
2. the products of the reaction with poly ( u ) ( 10 mm edta present ) can be separated on <unk> into oligonucleotides of increasing chain length .
most of the products are <unk> to <unk> which contain terminal <unk> groups .
3. when edta is not present ( ph 7.8 or 8.8 ) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly ( a ) and poly ( u ) .
with poly ( a ) the product is all nucleoside while with poly ( u ) as substrate most of the product is nucleoside , but also some oligonucleotides are produced .
<unk> the ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from high concentrations of poly ( u ) ( mg/ml ) .
5. uridine trinucleotide with and without a terminal <unk> group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane .
the trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the trinucleotide itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products , including nucleoside .
alterations in <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> activity due to lipid fluidity .
effects of cholesterol and <unk> .
the ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> , <unk> atpase from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated , soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids , using <unk> .
this preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by <unk> liposomes of phosphatidylserine , but not by <unk> phosphatidylserine liposomes or <unk> phosphatidylcholine liposomes .
the reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> in its ph optimum being around 7.0 , showing optimal activity at <unk> : atp mol ratios of approximately 1 and a km value for atp of 0.4 mm .
arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant ph of 7.0 and an <unk> : atp mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity ( sharp change of slope ) at 17 degrees c , with activation energy ( ea ) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it .
a further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees c and the ea below this was very high ( greater than 100 kcal/mol ) .
increased <unk> concentrations at <unk> : atp ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the arrhenius plots .
the addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> reactivation .
arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees c and ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively .
the <unk> <unk> normally showed a linear arrhenius plot with an ea of 8 kcal/mol .
the <unk> mixed liposomes stimulated the <unk> activity , which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees c with , however , an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below .
kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the km values for atp .
since both cholesterol and <unk> are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids , the above results are discussed in this context .
conformational and molecular responses to ph variation of the purified membrane adenosine <unk> of micrococcus <unk> .
a preparation of atpase from the membranes of micrococcus <unk> , <unk> and more than 95 % pure , showed two main bands in analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
they did not correspond to isoenzymes because one band could be converted into the other by exposure to a mildly alkaline ph value .
the conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight , circular dichroism and catalytic properties .
denaturation by ph at 25 degrees c was followed by means of circular dichroism , <unk> and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
a large conformational transition took place in the acid range with midpoints at about ph = 3.6 ( i = 10 ( -4 ) m ) , 4.3 ( i = 0.03 m ) and 5.3 ( i = 0.1 m ) .
the transition was irreversible .
strong aggregation of the protein occurred in this range of ph .
the final product was largely random coil , but even at ph 1.5 dissociation into individual subunits was not complete .
however , partial dissociation took place at ph 5 ( i = 0.028 m ) .
at this ph value the enzyme was inactive , but 20-30 % of the activity could be recovered when the ph was returned to 7.5 .
in the alkaline region the midpoint of the transition occurred near ph = 11 ( i = 0.028 m ) .
the pk of most of the tyrosine residues of the protein was about 10.9 .
the unfolding was irreversible and the protein was soon converted into peptide species with molecular weights lower than those determined for the subunits by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate .
conventional proteolysis did not account for the transformation .
membrane-bound enzymes .
iii .
protease activity in <unk> in relation to erythrocyte membranes .
protease activity was detected in membranes of human bovine erythrocytes prepared by the conventional procedures which include washing and removal of the `` buffy layer '' .
the enzyme was extracted by 0.75 m <unk> or ( nh4 ) <unk> and was activated by 0.4 to 0.5 m of the same salts .
colored , particulate hide <unk> , membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin , casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the <unk> protease .
partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through <unk> electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25 % positively charged detergents like <unk> bromide .
an alkaline protease ( ph 7.4 ) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in <unk> .
the similarity between the properties of the <unk> and <unk> proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations , suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating <unk> are responsible for the activity of <unk> proteases in erythrocytes .
[ structure formation in interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid boundaries ] .
in connection with the modelling of <unk> regularities of the formation and development of interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid borders under different conditions and depending on the nature of carbohydrate phase were investigated by the determination of mechanical characteristics of such layers .
the investigations carried out showed that the most solid layers appeared under the conditions which assured the formation of the maximum number of intermolecular bonds ( which in a common case is performed with maximum <unk> of the macromolecules which get at the interphase ) .
[ relation between fluorescence and circular dichroism of the complex of the fluorescence probe <unk> with serum albumin ] .
the fluorescence probe ( <unk> ; dmh ) was <unk> linked to human serum albumin ( hsa ) .
the variation of ph was due to serum albumin structural changes , which was determined in terms of dmh and hsa fluorescence and cd spectra .
considerable changes of fluorescence and cd spectra were observed at ph 8 and 10 , where there is ionization of two more recently titrated <unk> residues .
it is assumed that these two tyrosine residues are in binding region and quench the fluorescence of dmh between ph 4 to 8 .
quenching disappears if these residues are ionized ( ph greater than 8 ) or if the protein undergoes the n <unk> transition ( ph less than 4 ) .
[ luminescence study of the effect of temperature on the conformational state of fibrinogen ] .
results are presented of measuring fibrinogen fluorescence parameters in temperature range of <unk> degrees c at different ph of the solution .
it was found that the temperature increase from 20 to 40 degrees c for solutions with ph of <unk> were not accompanied by the conformational changes of fibrinogen macromolecules .
in the temperature range of 40-50 degrees c for neutral solutions conformational reconstruction of fibrinogen of <unk> character took place .
temperature increase above 50-55 degrees c brings about significant structural changes of fibrinogen molecule which are of denaturation nature .
polymer concentration dependence of the helix to random coil transition of a charged polypeptide in aqueous salt solution .
the helix to coil transition of poly ( <unk> acid ) was investigated in 0.05 and 0.005 m aqueous potassium chloride solutions by use of potentiometric titration and circular dichroism measurement .
polymer concentration dependence of the transition was observed in the range from 0.006 to 0.04 <unk> in 0.005 m kg1 solution .
the polymer concentration dependence can be interpreted by current theories of the transition of charged polypeptides and of titration curves of linear weak polyelectrolytes taking the effect of polymer concentration into consideration .

[ combined effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on the functional state of the respiratory center ] .
experiments were conducted on cats under nembutal anesthesia ; a study was made of pulse activity of bulbar respiratory neurons , electrical activity of the diaphragm and of the intercostal muscles ; po2 , pco2 , ph , arterial blood oxygen saturation were determined in combined action of hypoxia and hypercapnia .
when hypoxic gaseous mixture was given for respiration the developing <unk> disturbed the discharge rhythmic activity of the respiratory neurons , the respiration acquiring a pathological character of the cheyne -- stokes type .
after addition to the hypoxic gaseous mixture of 2 % co2 the gaseous composition of the arterial blood approached the initial values ; this addition prevented the development of hypercapnia and disturbances of rhythmic discharge activity of the respiratory neurons .
addition of 5 % co2 to the hypoxic gaseous mixture produced a negative effect : at first it intensified and then depressed the pulse activity of the respiratory neurons , caused metabolic and respiratory acidosis , and promoted asphyxia .
[ level of nicotinamide coenzymes in the liver and myocardium of rats poisoned with <unk> ] .
experiments were conducted on male rats .
a study was made of the content of nicotinamide coenzymes in the liver and myocardium 24 hours after the administration of 0.5 ml of <unk> into the stomach .
in parallel with disturbance of the morphological structure of the liver and of the myocardium , increase in the activity of alanine and <unk> <unk> in the blood serum , <unk> reduced the content of nicotinamide coenzymes and deranged the ratio of their oxidized and reduced forms in these organs .
[ effect of <unk> on conditioned defense reflexes ] .
chronic experiments were conducted on rats and rabbits ; a study was made of the effect of <unk> on the conditioned defence reflexes in stimulation of the <unk> part of the reticular formation .
<unk> prevented the depression of the conditioned defence reflexes caused by stimulation of the <unk> portion of the reticular formation .
this pointed to its depressive influence on the mentioned structures , and was confirmed by experiments on rabbits in recording changes in <unk> under conditions of stimulation of the <unk> reticular formation .
[ level of nicotinamide coenzymes in the myocardium of rats during the effects of <unk> ( theophylline , theobromine , caffeine ) and catecholamines ] .
it was shown in acute experiments on rats that one hour after an intraperitoneal injection of theophylline ( 50 mg/kg ) there was a decrease in the nad + nadp content by 19.4 % , a tendency to a fall of <unk> + <unk> was expressed , and the total nicotinamide <unk> level was reduced .
a tendency to decrease nad + nadp and the total pyridine nucleotide level was seen after caffeine administration .
the action of catecholamines and <unk> was compared .
theobromine produced no significant effect on the indices under study .
it was shown that <unk> decreased the nad + nadp level ; adrenaline ( 25 <unk> ) increased the content of both the oxidized ( by 24 % ) and of the reduced ( by 48 % ) forms of pyridine nucleotides .
an increase of adrenaline dose to 1000 <unk> was accompanied by reduction of the oxidized forms ( by 22.2 % ) and of the total nicotinamide <unk> level ( by 18 % ) .
potable water quality in rural georgetown county .
drinking water supplies of 161 rural communities , in georgetown county , south carolina , were randomly selected for sample collection .
the analysis showed that most of the waters were slightly acidic .
low , but acceptable concentrations of chloride , copper , fluoride , sodium , cadmium , nitrate and phosphate were found .
a few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic , mercury , zinc and lead .
although only 2 % of the samples exceeded the mandatory limit of 0.05 ppm for arsenic , 72 % exceeded the recommended level of 0.01 ppm .
the mandatory limit for manganese was exceeded in 37 % of the waters while 88 % exceeded the limit for iron .
the high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in 45 % of the samples .
the well depth and the consumer income had some bearing on water quality .
statistical evidence suggested that septic tank seepage was partially responsible for nitrate , phosphate , iron and arsenic contamination of shallow water supplies .
lead concentrations appear to vary according to the plumbing used and the ph of the waters .

the importance of an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus in preventing postoperative <unk> reflux and gastritis .
this study has investigated the relationship between <unk> reflux , gastritis and certain symptoms 6-12 months after three operations for uncomplicated duodenal ulcer .
the operations studied were proximal gastric <unk> ( <unk> , 20 cases ) , <unk> <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , 22 cases ) and <unk> <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , 21 cases ) .
<unk> reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation .
incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy .
symptoms were assessed by symptomatic score and <unk> grading .
there was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy ( p less than <unk> ) .
there was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn , epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation .
the amount of reflux did not differ before operation .
there was significantly less reflux following <unk> than after either <unk> ( p less than <unk> ) or <unk> ( p less than <unk> ) .
the results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative <unk> reflux , gastritis and symptoms .
haemoglobin <unk> ( beta <unk> ) : a new high affinity haemoglobin associated with decreased 2 , <unk> binding and relative <unk> .
a new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity , <unk> ( <unk> ) lysine leads to threonine ( hb <unk> ) , was found during the investigation of a patient who was found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count .
the substitution affects one of the 2 , <unk> binding sites , resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen , but both the <unk> interaction and the alkaline bohr effect are normal in the <unk> .
this variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin a on electrophoresis at alkaline ph but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity ; it could be separated from haemoglobin a , however , by electrophoresis in agar at acid ph .
the raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume ( a relative <unk> ) and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count .
this case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with absolute or relative <unk> when some obvious cause is not evident .

inhibitory postsynaptic actions of taurine , gaba and other amino acids on motoneurons of the isolated frog spinal cord .
the actions of glycine , gaba , <unk> , <unk> and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons of the isolated spinal cord of the frog .
all amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials , a blockade of the <unk> action potential and an increase of membrane conductance .
furthermore , membrane polarizations occurred , which were always in the same direction as the ipsp .
all these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids .
when the relative strength of different amino acids was compared , taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency , followed by <unk> , <unk> , gaba and glycine .
topically applied strychnine and <unk> induced different changes of post-synaptic potentials , indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be influenced by these two <unk> .
interactions with amino acids showed that <unk> <unk> diminished the <unk> actions of gaba , while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine , glycine , <unk> and <unk> .
but differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected : the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine , <unk> and <unk> .
with regard to these results the importance of taurine and gaba as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed .
the involvement of <unk> in neurotransmitter release ; the composition and turnover of phospholipids of synaptic vesicles of <unk> cerebral cortex and torpedo electric organ and the effect of stimulation .
( 1 ) crude <unk> fractions ( p2 ) derived from <unk> cerebral cortex were incubated in the presence of 50 mm kcl in a <unk> medium .
torpedo marmorata electric organs were stimulated electrically in vivo at 5 <unk> for 30 min by electrodes placed on the electric lobe .
synaptic vesicles were isolated from each source and the phospholipid compositions analysed and compared with vesicles from <unk> controls .
( 2 ) <unk> was the only <unk> demonstrable in the synaptic vesicles from either source and its low levels did not increase as a result of chemical or <unk> stimulation .
in each case there was a close similarity of the phospholipid distributions in the vesicles taken from control and stimulated samples .
( 3 ) control experiments indicated extensive decreases in the acetylcholine content of the vesicles from the stimulated electric organ and smaller decreases in the acetylcholine content of the synaptic vesicles from stimulated crude <unk> fractions .
these fractions were found to respire linearly in the presence of 10 mm glucose and the vesicle fractions were shown to have low levels of <unk> membranes as judged by marker enzyme analyses .
( 4 ) crude <unk> fractions from <unk> cerebral cortex were incubated in a <unk> medium with labelled fatty acids and [ 3h ] glucose in the presence or absence of 50 mm kcl .
<unk> fractionation was carried out and specific <unk> of phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylethanolamine , phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were determined in fractions d ( synaptic vesicles ) , e ( <unk> ) and h ( disrupted <unk> ) .
the release of neurotransmitter did not significantly enhance the labelling of phospholipids in any of the fractions studied as compared with phospholipids from <unk> fractions .
this was found after two incubation times and using [ 14c ] <unk> , [ 14c ] <unk> , [ 3h ] palmitate and [ 3h ] glucose .
uptake of radiolabeled glucose analogues by <unk> pia arachnoid cultures .

cardiac output response to altered acid-base status during diethyl ether anaesthesia .
the effects of acid-base changes on cardiac output during diethyl ether anaesthesia were studied in 25 mongrel dogs prepared by surgically implanting a plastic encased non-ferrous core electromagnetic probe on the ascending aorta .
the findings are : ( 1 ) metabolic <unk> produced only slight decrease in cardiac output but a more marked fall became evident with decreasing ph ( 2 ) respiratory <unk> led to a slight rise in cardiac output .
( 3 ) respiratory <unk> decreased cardiac output .
( 4 ) metabolic <unk> also produced a decline in cardiac output .
the prevention of autolysis of stored cornea using steroid as a lysosome membrane stabilizer .
many eyes donated for use in corneal grafting are rejected because of signs of autolysis in the donor material .
the purpose of this experimental study was to determine whether hydrocortisone acting as a lysosome membrane stabilizer could prevent or retard autolysis of the corneas under storage , and if so , what was the most efficacious concentration .
different groups of rabbit corneas were placed in saline as controls or in varying concentrations of hydrocortisone ( 10 ( -10 ) m to 10 ( -4 ) m at ph 7.4 ) at 37 degrees c and 4 degrees c .
acid phosphatase released after six hours was measured biochemically .
this enzyme was used as a marker enzyme reflecting lysosomal <unk> .
results showed a significant stabilization of the lysosomal membrane at 4 degrees c as compared to 37 degrees c .
a trend towards stabilization of the lysosomal membrane was seen when 10 ( -8 ) m concentration of hydrocortisone at 37 degrees c was used , there being no demonstrable stabilization at 4 degrees c .
respiratory effects of <unk> and <unk> injections into the brain stem subarachnoid space of fetal lambs .
mock cerebrospinal fluid ( ph <unk> ) or <unk> ( dnp ) ( <unk> mg ) was injected into the subarachnoid space of the ventral brain stem of <unk> fetal sheep .
changes in ph on the ventral surface of the medulla did not stimulate respiratory efforts or induce significant cardiovascular changes .
the respiratory response to dnp injections ranged from no response to prolonged rhythmic ventilation that was independent of the peripheral chemoreceptors or the control arterial ph and blood gas tensions .
this inconsistency suggests an effector site somewhat removed from the immediate surface of the medulla .
the heart rate and blood pressure were not affected .
it is concluded that increased <unk> concentration in the extracellular fluid of the fetal ventral medulla does not initiate respiration , and any respiratory response to metabolic inhibitors applied to this area therefore is not attributable to a secondary change in surface ph .
soil <unk> : elevation of the exogenous carbon and nitrogen requirements for spore germination by <unk> volatiles in soils .
<unk> , washed conidia of fusarium solani f. sp. <unk> , aspergillus flavus , and verticillium <unk> were placed on washed <unk> purified agar discs along with an inorganic salt solution containing various levels of carbon and nitrogen substrates .
these discs were exposed to volatiles from six soils ( ph <unk> ) .
fusarium solani <unk> germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from soils of ph 5.1 , 6.1 , 7.0 , and 7.5 , but high levels of glucose and <unk> reversed this inhibition , raising germination to that of <unk> , <unk> or nitrogen controls .
<unk> germination of a. flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles from high ph ( 7.0 , 7.8 , and 8.6 ) soils , and increased levels of glucose plus an amino acid mixture nullified this inhibition .
volatiles from soils of ph 5.1 , 6.1 , and 7.5 stimulated a. flavus <unk> germination .
assays after the removal of co2 from the air above soil of ph 5.1 demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory to a. flavus were produced by this soil .
assays indicated that a <unk> compound was a <unk> soil volatile to f. solani <unk> germination .
the nullification by carbon and nitrogen substrates of f. solani and a. flavus inhibition caused by soil volatiles parallels that for soil <unk> .
<unk> germination of v. <unk> was markedly stimulated by volatiles in all soils tested , and was not affected by removal of co2 .
inhibitory soil volatiles may increase the nutritional requirements for spore germination of certain fungi .
<unk> enzymes in e. coli and their role in drug activation in vivo .
earlier work showed that escherichia coli contains at least two enzymes which reduce <unk> and other nitrofuran derivatives .
one of these enzymes is lacking in some <unk> mutant strains .
we now report that there are three separable nitrofuran reductases in this organism : reductase i ( <unk> <unk> approximately 50 000 , insensitive to o2 ) , reductase iia ( <unk> <unk> approximately 120 000 , inhibited by oxygen ) , reductase iib ( <unk> <unk> approximately 700 000 , inhibited by o2 ) .
unstable metabolites formed during the reduction of <unk> by preparations containing reductases iia and iib produce breaks in dna in vitro .
in vivo experiments with <unk> strains , which lack reductase ii but contain reductases iia and iib , demonstrated that lethality , mutation , and dna breakage are all greatly increased when cultures are incubated under anaerobic conditions , i.e. , conditions such that reductase ii is active .
these results provide further evidence for the importance of reductive activation of <unk> .
enzymatic hydrolysis of agar : purification and characterization of <unk> hydrolase and <unk> <unk> hydrolase .
the mixture of polysaccharides in the gelling component of agar ( agarose ) is hydrolyzed to <unk> and <unk> by a series of hydrolytic enzymes obtained from pseudomonas atlantica .
the final <unk> step in the pathway of agarose decomposition is the hydrolysis of the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> yielding <unk> and <unk> .
pseudomonas atlantica when grown on agar produces two specific enzymes , <unk> <unk> hydrolase and <unk> hydrolase .
the purification and partial characterization of both enzymes are presented .
temperature and ph optima for 21 species of thermophilic and <unk> fungi .
a <unk> mineral medium supplemented with 0.01 % yeast extract is described upon which all the species of thermophilic and <unk> fungi tested will grow .
thirteen of the 21 species do not require the yeast extract supplement for growth .
using this solid , supplemented mineral medium , the ph and temperature optima for growth of all strains were measured .
no correlation was found between temperature optimum and ph optimum among members of the group tested .
physiological differences among isolates of phytophthora cinnamomi .
significant differences in amylase , <unk> , and phosphatase activities were observed among four phytophthora cinnamomi isolates grown in <unk> sterilized soil for 20 days .
amylase ph optima for the four isolates were within a relatively narrow range ; at ph 5.5 each isolate was within 90 % of its peak activity .
isolates <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> each exhibited maximal <unk> activity at ph 5.0 and maximal phosphatase activity at ph <unk> .
maximal activity for these two enzymes of isolate <unk> occurred at ph 3.5 .
in timed experiments , isolates <unk> and <unk> exhibited greater amylase activities than did the other two isolates .
for <unk> , greatest activity was observed for <unk> ; activity of <unk> was intermediate and least activity was observed for isolates <unk> and <unk> .
isolates <unk> and <unk> exhibited greatest phosphatase activities ; isolate <unk> was intermediate in activity , and <unk> was least active .
results indicate that significant differences exist among the isolates tested and that these differences can be quantitatively measured by the methods described .
regulation and properties of an <unk> from clostridium <unk> .
an intracellular <unk> was induced in cultures of clostridium <unk> utilizing sucrose as its carbon source for growth .
this enzyme synthesis could be repressed by the addition of fructose of a <unk> culture .
in contrast , <unk> activity was not affected by the addition of glucose to <unk> cells and this enzyme could be induced in a <unk> culture by the addition of sucrose .
this enzyme was purified <unk> over the induced lese , ec <unk> ) by <unk> studies .
<unk> had a ph optimum of 6.5 and an apparent km of 79.5 mm for sucrose , and required high concentration of potassium phosphate for maximum activity .
<unk> was completely inactivated by a <unk> heat treatment at 60 degrees c .
this enzyme was strongly inhibited by <unk> ( <unk> ) and weakly inhibited by <unk> ( <unk> acid ) , while cysteine could substantially reverse <unk> ) inhibition , suggesting that sulfhydryl group ( s ) were necessary for <unk> activity .
characterization studies on the membrane-bound adenosine <unk> ( atpase ) of azotobacter <unk> .
the <unk> ( atpase ) ( ec <unk> ) activity in azotobacter <unk> concentrates in the membranous r3 fraction that is directly associated with azotobacter electron transport function .
sonically disrupted azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of atpase activity and the highest specific activity ( and activity units ) was consistently found in the particulate r3 membranous fraction which sediments on <unk> at 144 000 x g for 2 h .
when the sonication time interval was increased , the membrane-bound atpase activity could neither be <unk> nor released into the supernatant fraction .
optimal atpase <unk> occurred at ph 8.0 ; <unk> ion when added to the assay was stimulatory .
maximal activity always occurred when the <unk> : atp stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mm concentration level .
sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect .
the reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied ( 0-60 min ) .
the membrane-bound atpase in the r3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment with trypsin , and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not <unk> atpase activity off the membranous r3 electron transport fraction .
the atpase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the r3 fraction had no effect on activity ; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees c , however , resulted in a 25 % loss of activity as compared with a 14 % loss when the r3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees c .
a marked inactivation ( although variable , usually about 60 % ) did occur by overnight freezing ( -20 degrees c ) , and subsequent sonication failed to restore atpase activity .
this indicates that membrane <unk> ( by freezing ) was not responsible for atpase inactivation .
the addition of azide , ouabain , <unk> , or <unk> to the assay system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the atpase activity .
the property of trypsin activation and that atpase activity is highest in the r3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation .
effects of <unk> emissions on forest soil microflora .
within 2 km of a zinc ( zn ) smelter in palmerton , pennsylvania , near the lehigh water gap , up to 13.5 % zn by weight has been measured in the o2 horizon of the soil , and up to 8 % zn in the a1 horizon .
the total numbers of bacteria , actinomycetes , and fungi ( measured by dilution plate counts ) were greatly reduced in the most severely <unk> soils compared with control soils .
the reduction of microbial populations may be a partial cause of the decreased rate of litter decomposition at lehigh gap .
growth of most bacteria from control sites was reduced by 100 to 200 mum zn , most actinomycetes by 100 mum zn , and most fungi by 100 to 1000 mum zn in <unk> extract agar ( <unk> ) .
all the tested actinomycetes and non-spore-forming bacteria isolated from <unk> lehigh gap soils were <unk> , growing normally in media containing <unk> mum zn .
most fungi , regardless of source , were capable of at least 50 % of normal growth at 700 mum zn .
<unk> bacteria , actinomycetes , and fungi were readily isolated from <unk> soils , suggesting that selection for zn tolerance may proceed rapidly .
acidophilic <unk> species have been selectively eliminated near the smelter , apparently because of elevated soil ph .
<unk> glomerata ( corda ) <unk> and <unk> spp. were found only in the <unk> soils .

cytotoxic interaction between gorgonian <unk> : mode of action .
the effects of the continuous administration of n , <unk> ( dab ) on the activities and the <unk> of some <unk> enzymes in rat liver .
( 1 ) the effect of feeding a relatively <unk> diet containing 0.06 % dab for 29 weeks on the activity of <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> acid ) , <unk> ( n , <unk> ) , <unk> ( dab ) , cytochrome p-450 , <unk> c reductase , <unk> and <unk> a were studied .
rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes , reaching minimal values at between 4 and 8 weeks .
activities then increased in all cases to control or nearly control levels .
this rate of increase was least for cytochrome p-450 .
at 4 weeks <unk> activity with the chemotherapeutic agent <unk> ( i ) as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats .
early increases occurred in the activities of <unk> and <unk> a and the activity of the latter never dropped below the control level .
( 2 ) an investigation was made of the differential effects of dye feeding on some of the enzyme activities in the two major liver lobes and differences were found .
( 3 ) the effect of phenobarbital ( pb ) pretreatment on the <unk> rats was studied at 4-week intervals .
the activities of <unk> and of <unk> increased throughout the whole period , while the activities of the lysosomal enzymes were decreased .
( 4 ) after feeding dab for 4 weeks the effect of pb and <unk> ( mc ) on the activities of <unk> , <unk> and components of the <unk> p-450 , <unk> c reductase , the <unk> was not induced by pb or mc , and co did not inhibit its reduction .
its reduction depended only slightly on nadh .
co caused a greater relative decrease in the activity of <unk> in <unk> animals and also in animals following pb and mc pretreatment , implying a greater role of cytochrome p-450 in <unk> animals .
some characteristics of two <unk> systems in rat liver .
relevance to the activity of <unk> [ <unk> ( 2 '' <unk> ) <unk> ] benzoic acid ( <unk> ) , a compound possessing latent cytotoxic activity .
the system involved in the reduction of <unk> [ <unk> ( 2 '' <unk> ) <unk> acid ( <unk> ) , an agent designed for treating primary liver cell cancer , has been demonstrated to be localised mainly in the 108 000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver <unk> .
it is also present in other organs particularly in the spleen .
<unk> as shown previously is present almost entirely in the microsomal fraction and is found in high concentration only in liver .
the ph maximum for <unk> implying the importance of the <unk> group in determining substrate specificity .
the use of enzyme inhibitors and other additives showed that <unk> was not <unk> oxidase or dihydrofolate reductase .
its activity was not affected by carbon monoxide , <unk> ( pb ) , or <unk> ( mc ) pretreatment .
enhancement of the activity by ferrous ions and fad indicated that at least part of the reduction system could involve a flavoprotein with fad as the prosthetic group .
the activity of <unk> and <unk> was reduced by <unk> ( vitamin k3 ) , cyanide and <unk> .
a <unk> preparation from pig heart reduced both <unk> and <unk> with both <unk> and <unk> systems .
mercury inhibition of avian fatty acid synthetase complex .
( 1 ) subcutaneous or intra-abdominal injections of 8 mg of <unk> g body weight markedly depressed hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity of chicks at 1 h <unk> .
the depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks continued to eat up until the time they were killed .
under these same conditions , the hepatic activity of acetyl-coa carboxylase ( ec <unk> ) was not affected by <unk> , while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation was stimulated .
( 2 ) when <unk> was included in the incubation medium for a highly purified preparation of fatty acid synthetase , 500 mum <unk> was required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme .
when <unk> was omitted , 50 mum <unk> was inhibitory and 100 mum <unk> abolished enzyme activity .
( 3 ) 2 mm <unk> completely protected the purified fatty acid synthetase preparation from inhibition by 100 mum <unk> .
when <unk> was added after the addition of enzyme to the <unk> medium , protection of the enzyme was not complete .
( 4 ) dialysis of cytosol fractions from chicks injected with <unk> against 500 vol. of 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.0 ) containing 1 mm edta and 10 mm <unk> for 4 h at 4 degrees stimulated the fatty acid synthetase activity of the fractions .
dialysis of cytosol fractions from <unk> chicks under the same conditions was without effect on fatty acid synthetase activity .
( 5 ) these data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of <unk> administered in vivo on hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity in chicks is mediated through the interaction of mercury with the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme .
[ basic phospholipase of naja nigricollis venom ] .
it is confirmed that n. nigricollis venom contains several <unk> one of these is a basic phospholipase a .
this enzyme is toxic for mice when injected intravenously .
in vitro it reacts on egg yolk lecithin producing <unk> and prevents the phenomenon of blood clotting .
an immunological identity has been established between this basic phospholipase and two acidic <unk> present in the same venom .
[ spontaneous mortality and vascular lesions in 3 rat strains with different blood pressure levels ] .
we have observed a high and significant mortality in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to <unk> and hypotensive controls , in the fifth generation .
the hypertensive rats exhibited a high frequency of cerebral haemorrhage and <unk> nodosa .
effects of decreasing arterial blood pressure on cerebral blood flow in the baboon .
influence of the sympathetic nervous system .
the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean arterial blood pressure was studied in anesthetized baboons .
cerebral blood flow was measured by the <unk> clearance method , and arterial blood pressure was decreased by controlled hemorrhage .
in normal baboons , the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 65 % of the <unk> value ; thereafter , cerebral blood flow decreased when arterial blood pressure was reduced .
superior cervical sympathectomy of 2-3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response .
in contrast , both acute surgical sympathectomy ( cervical trunk division ) and <unk> blockade ( 1.5 mg/kg of <unk> ) enhanced the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that cerebral blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 35 % of the <unk> value .
the results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of a fall in arterial blood pressure .
indeed , the implication is that the <unk> discharge accompanying hemorrhagic hypotension is detrimental to , rather than responsible for , cerebral autoregulation .
influence of hematocrit , blood gas tensions , and ph on <unk> relations in the isolated canine lung .
an isolated perfused canine lung preparation in which determinants of vascular caliber could be individually controlled was developed .
the relation of pulmonary arterial ( pa ) , venous ( pv ) , and alveolar ( pa ) pressures was such that pa greater than pa greater than pv throughout the whole lung .
the addition of <unk> to the <unk> abolished vascular reactivity .
once stability was reached , vascular cross-sectional area remained acceptably constant for 2.25 hours as judged by normalized conductance .
the influence of <unk> hematocrit , blood gas tensions , and ph on <unk> relations was then studied in 15 isolated canine lungs .
the <unk> conductance relation was derived at constant perfusion pressure .
conductance varied linearly with hematocrit over a range of 16.5 to 89.5 % .
mean pulmonary arterial blood gas tensions were : po2 = 121 mm hg , pco2 = 28 mm hg , and ph = 7.46 .
acute respiratory acidosis ( po2 = 30 mm hg , pco2 = 81 mm hg , ph = 7.17 ) and lactic acidosis and hypoxemia ( po2 = 32 mm hg , pco2 = 21 mm hg , ph = 6.96 ) did not significantly alter this relation .
transformation of the <unk> data indicated that hematocrit was the most important determinant of relative apparent viscosity of the blood .
both acute respiratory and lactic acidosis failed to significantly increase relative viscosity within the range of hematocrit usually found in secondary polycythemia .
interaction of the <unk> and the pulmonary inflation reflex in the regulation of coronary circulation in conscious dogs .
the interaction of <unk> and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to <unk> stimulation ( <unk> injection of nicotine ) when ventilation was allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled .
the responses were also compared with those elicited by both forced mechanical and spontaneous hyperinflation .
when the heart rate was constant , <unk> administered nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic coronary flow from 48 <unk> 2 to 106 <unk> 8 ml/min and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from 1.62 <unk> 0.08 to 0.78 <unk> 0.06 mm <unk> <unk> .
after <unk> and cholinergic blockade , a similar coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was allowed to increase .
however , when ventilation was controlled , <unk> administered nicotine increased coronary resistance after combined <unk> and cholinergic blockade .
the reflex coronary dilation was not observed after carotid sinus nerve section or after <unk> blockade .
thus , nicotine stimulation of the carotid <unk> results in a striking coronary dilation that has two components .
the minor component involves a <unk> with its efferent pathway in tthe <unk> .
the major component of coronary dilation follows an increase in the depth of respiration , and its efferent component appears to involve withdrawal of <unk> constrictor tone .
an almost identical period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog .
effect of coronary blood flow on glycolytic flux and intracellular ph in isolated rat hearts .
the rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of <unk> utilization , tissue high-energy phosphates , and intracellular ph .
a 60 % reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a 30 % reduction in oxygen consumption , an accelerated rate of <unk> utilization , lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate , and higher tissue levels of lactate and <unk> .
ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and peak systolic pressure .
further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis , a greater decrease in tissue levels of high-energy phosphates , and higher tissue levels of both lactate and <unk> .
these changes in glycolytic flux , tissue metabolites , and ventricular performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow .
the importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in <unk> hearts is emphasized .
it is concluded that acceleration of atp production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery .
the central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of atp production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis .
mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic rat hearts .
the mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic myocardium were investigated in the isolated , perfused rat heart .
glycolysis was inhibited at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase .
the major factors that accounted for the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and <unk> in the ischemic tissue .
increased extracellular ph inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts .
however , maintenance of both extracellular and intracellular ph caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis in ischemic hearts .
accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary <unk> flow in both anoxic and ischemic hearts .
at intracellular lactate concentrations between 15 and 20 mm , glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions .
addition of either 10 , 20 , or 40 mm lactate to the <unk> inhibited glycolysis in aerobic , anoxic , and ischemic hearts .
the effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through changes in intracellular ph .
it is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents a major factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts .
comparison of contractile performance of canine atrial and ventricular muscles .
this study compared the contractile performance of a canine right atrial <unk> with that of a macroscopically indistinguishable <unk> isolated from the right ventricular apex .
the heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies weighing 6-8 kg and placed in <unk> bicarbonate solution .
the bathing solution contained only 1.25 <unk> of <unk> and was bubbled with a 95 % <unk> % co2 gas mixture .
each atrial <unk> was specially selected from the right atrial appendage .
histologically , these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal orientation of the fibers .
at <unk> ( the length of the muscle at which developed tension was maximum ) under identical conditions of temperature , rate of stimulation , ionic milieu , ph , and o2 and co2 supply , right atrial trabeculae achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular trabeculae .
in both muscle groups the maximum developed tension averaged about 2.5 <unk> .
since lo ( expressed as a fraction of <unk> ) was less in atrial muscle than it was in <unk> muscle , we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum length is reached .
at any given initial muscle length , the maximum of tension rise for atrial trabeculae amounted to at least twice that for ventricular trabeculae .
at any given load up to 1.5 <unk> , the maximum velocity of shortening of an atrial <unk> was about three to four times that of a ventricular <unk> .
these results collectively indicate that the contractile performance of the right atrial muscle is in many respects superior to that of the right ventricle , at least under the conditions of these experiments .
serum lactate dehydrogenase activity ratios with different substrates .
1. the lactate dehydrogenase activity of 89 sera from patients suffering myocardial infarction and of 55 sera from patients with hepatocellular damage was assayed under optimal conditions using pyruvate , <unk> , <unk> and glyoxylate as substrates .
activity was also measured with lactate as substrate at different ph values .
2. the ratios of activities under these different assay conditions were calculated for both series of patients .
correct differentiations for single ratios ranged from virtually nil for <unk> to is greater than 93 per cent for <unk> and <unk> .
this was little improved by the use of multiple ratios involving up to seven separate assays .
3. the activity ratio of <unk> to pyruvate which is consistently greater than unity was found to be inverted in a case of morphine poisoning .
<unk> assay for <unk> .
we describe a simple , rapid <unk> assay for separate quantitative analysis of <unk> and <unk> in mixtures .
the effective <unk> range ( fluorescence vs. concentration ) in serum is 0.1 to 10.0 <unk> , regardless of the ratio ( by weight ) of the two drugs from 1:10 to 10:1 .
analytical recoveries by the extraction method used were 100.0 <unk> 3.0 % and 98.0 <unk> 4.0 % , respectively .
for determination of either compound , the maximum coefficient of variation was 10 % .
rapid kinetic measurement of lactate in plasma with a centrifugal analyzer .
in this method , blood is collected in ammonium <unk> <unk> tubes and lactate is directly determined in the plasma , separated within 15 min from the erythrocytes .
lactate is assayed by mixing 10 mul of sample with <unk> and lactate dehydrogenase in tris ( hydroxymethyl ) <unk> hydrazine buffer .
the rate of increase in absorbance of the nadh formed , measured at 340 nm , is proportional to lactate concentration .
the assay is complete in 4 min and absorbance is linearly related to concentration from 0.625 to 15 <unk> .
analytical recoveries of lactate added to plasma averaged 104 % ( range , <unk> % ) .
results compared well for plasma samples analyzed by this method with the <unk> and the du pont aca .
improved high-resolution high-voltage paper electrophoresis system for use in screening for <unk> .
high-voltage paper electrophoresis of small samples of serum and urine at ph 6.0 resolves basic and acidic amino acids and separates them from the neutral amino acids .
for separation and identification of the neutral amino acids , the appropriate area of the <unk> is cut out , sewn onto a second sheet of paper , and rerun at ph 1.9 .
by this method , amino acids are rapidly resolved .
it is suited for use with special procedures such as oxidation of biological fluid with <unk> acid and specific staining for confirmation of amino acid identification .

problems associated with the determination of <unk> a and b using <unk> sulfate substrate .
a clinical method for the determination of serum <unk> <unk> .
a simple , highly sensitive and reproducible method for the assay of <unk> <unk> ( ec <unk> ) activity is introduced , using <unk> as a substrate and <unk> as an acceptor in 50 g/l of <unk> nonylphenol .
serum <unk> activity was assayed in 1080 healthy adults , the normal mean value being 14.8 <unk> .
the diagnostic evaluation of the enzyme in various hepatobiliary diseases is also discussed .
[ inborn error of glycolipid metabolism ] .
treatment of renal hypertension .
there are different types of renal hypertension : hypertension due to parenchymal renal disease , <unk> hypertension , hypertension due to urological disease , hypertension of <unk> renal disease .
treatment has to <unk> <unk> possibility of specific , medical or surgical procedures that may cause the underlying condition .
if the underlying disease is not amenable to specific therapy , symptomatic medical treatment to lower blood pressure is indicated : besides control of <unk> and body weight antihypertensive drugs are generally indicated .
we use them , alone or in combination , in the following line of order : diuretics , beta-adrenergic blockers , <unk> , reserpine , clonidine , <unk> , <unk> .
effects of graded infusions of <unk> on coagulation , blood lipids , respiration and circulation .
an experimental study in dogs .
in 4 dogs injected intravenously ( i.v. ) with <unk> labeled fibrinogen , <unk> labeled platelets and 99mtc labeled albumin , and subjected to successively increasing amounts of i.v. infused <unk> , doses corresponding to the amounts released into the blood stream following implantation of acrylic cement during total hip replacements did not affect the clotting mechanism , did not cause trapping of platelets and fibrin in the lungs , did not generate fat emboli , and did not cause depression of the arterial oxygen tension or blood pressure .
<unk> in whole blood was associated with both blood cells and plasma .
some pharmacologic aspects of the antihistamines .
a survey of current clinical applications .
anaerobic glycolysis in normal human erythrocytes incubated in vitro with sodium salicylate .
1. some effects of sodium salicylate upon anaerobic glycolysis have been studied in normal human erythrocytes incubated for up to 6 h at 37 degrees c in autologous sera .
2. both glucose consumption and lactate production were stimulated by concentrations of salicylate up to 60 mmol/l but at the highest concentration used ( 90 mmol/l ) an initial stimulus was followed by inhibition of glycolysis .
3. losses occurred of adenosine <unk> ( atp ) , adenosine <unk> ( adp ) and adenosine <unk> ( amp ) at higher concentrations of salicylate and there was a concomitant increase of inorganic phosphate .
<unk> other phosphate esters underwent concentration changes at higher concentrations of salicylate that reflected inadequate concentrations of atp for glycolysis .
5. the rates of sodium efflux from , and potassium influx into , erythrocytes were unaffected by the presence of salicylate at concentrations sufficient to stimulate glycolysis .
arterial catecholamines in hypoxic exercise in man .
1. we measured the minute ventilation and arterial blood catecholamine concentrations in four normal men standing and at two levels of moderate treadmill exercise breathing 14 % oxygen or air .
2. minute ventilation was significantly higher during hypoxic exercise than during <unk> exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 <unk> 3 .
arterial plasma noradrenaline during hypoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was significantly greater than at rest .
<unk> arterial plasma noradrenaline during <unk> exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was not elevated above the resting concentration .
5. the results are compatible with the suggestion that increased concentrations of arterial plasma noradrenaline contribute to the hypoxic potentiation of the respiratory response to moderate exercise .

influence of ph and hypoxia on the success of defibrillation .
clinical impressions about the problem of defibrillation during states of acid-base imbalance and hypoxia have been influenced by studies involving the effect of these derangements on the ventricular fibrillation threshold .
based on body weight , energy requirements for defibrillation in normal dogs were compared to requirements in dogs subjected to commonly encountered acid-base disturbances and severe hypoxemia .
no significant differences were found .
seventy-five percent of all animals in the study were electrically converted with <unk> levels of energy .
the incidence of spontaneous resumption of circulation following defibrillation was lowest in animals subjected to metabolic acidosis and hypoxia .
the results suggest that ph and blood gas alterations , previously shown to influence the normal ventricular fibrillation threshold , do not significantly affect the normal defibrillation threshold .

charge properties of human pituitary and amniotic fluid <unk> .
the apparent isoelectric points ( pi ) in isoelectric focusing ( if ) of human pituitary and amniotic fluid prolactin ( <unk> ) , both <unk> and iodinated , were determined .
unresolved mixtures of pituitary <unk> <unk> e and f , and of at least five <unk> found in amniotic fluid , and plasma <unk> exhibit an average pi value of 6.5 - 6.7 .
transient state ph values observed or previously reported for <unk> components range from ph 5.9 to 6.8 after correction to standard conditions .
at ph 8.1 , the major <unk> , <unk> , carriers a charge of 2.2 net protons per molecule .
the net charge differences among <unk> e , f and g are compatible with acquisition or loss of single charged groups per 20,000 molecular weight .
this net charge is similar to that of the least <unk> major <unk> of human growth hormone ( <unk> ) , while the hgh with a bioactivity comparable to that of <unk> exhibits a net charge of 3.4 valence units .
the `` large '' <unk> j and h increased net charges , by a factor of 2-3 , in direct proportion to their size increments .
human and monkey prolactin and growth hormone : separation of polymorphic forms by isoelectric focusing .
the feasibility of using isoelectric focusing for the separation of primate pituitary growth hormone from prolactin and for the characterization of polymorphic forms of these hormones was explored .
in a ph 3 -- 10 gradient , extracts of both human and <unk> monkey <unk> were each resolved into 4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components , as shown by <unk> .
in narrower gradients ( of 2 -- 3 ph units ) greater resolution was achieved ; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components .
a partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain 4 prolactin components , one of which had a <unk> hormone ratio of 760 .
clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin and 5 growth hormone components , many of which had higher pi values than those found in pituitary extract .
under the conditions used , both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point .
some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2 % growth hormone by <unk> .
monkey growth hormone containing 0.01 % prolactin was isolated .
these findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another .
furthermore , the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in preparations obtained by several methods and from 2 different species , suggesting that these forms are not artifacts .

ecological observation of the <unk> in beef of animals from the <unk> area .
certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the bavarian sub-alpine mountains and in the alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and farm structures similar to those in the northern part of scandinavia .
in 1963/64 , the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present , we established in 600 beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle ( mainly highland cattle ) close connections between the <unk> of green crop and the long <unk> yearly precipitation quantities , as well as certain relations between the <unk> of meat and differences in the feeding and keeping of the animals .
during <unk> ( <unk> ) , beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall ( alps ) was <unk> by 137cs up to 15 times more than that of confined animals .
hereby the rate of <unk> in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation .
when confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for 2 to 3 weeks , a quick increase of <unk> of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle .
the lower <unk> in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder , which is at that time less contaminated than green crop .
during the winter season ( november to march ) , the highest contaminations in the meat of confined ( bohemian forest ) or grazing cattle ( alps ) was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own <unk> or with leafy silage .
the highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in january , february and march , as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed .
here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle .
after the quick decrease of 137cs in fallout noticed in the years 1964 and 1965 , in 1965/66 a dependance in the <unk> of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases ( alps , <unk> and bohemian forest ) ; though in general , meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation .
liver microsomal <unk> and <unk> .
both <unk> ( gt ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) were assayed in untreated liver <unk> .
optimum assay conditions were established with rat liver <unk> using <unk> ( pnp ) and its glucuronide ( <unk> ) at the ph optima of gt ( 7.5 ) and <unk> ( 4.5 ) .
the activities of the two enzymes were compared using <unk> from rats , mice , pigs , cattle and horses , with pnp , <unk> , and phenolphthalein as substrate , in the presence of various cofactors and inhibitors at ph 7.5 and 4.5 .
these data disclose pronounced differences with respect to species , substrate and other experimental conditions , thereby precluding the establishment of general optimum conditions .
the two enzymes were also assayed under strictly identical conditions using pnp and <unk> and rat liver <unk> at ph 7.5 in the presence and absence of <unk> disodium ( <unk> ) , activators ( atp ; <unk> ) and inhibitors .
when provided with a functional level of <unk> , both enzymes proved active under those conditions , and a <unk> interplay was indicated .
the two processes could be selectively and totally inhibited by <unk> and <unk> .
the results suggest that <unk> cycles may be operative in the metabolism of drugs in vivo , taking place already at the level of the liver endoplasmic reticulum .
biochemical aspects of renal ammonia formation in metabolic acidosis .
in omnivorous creatures , the diet is <unk> , especially as a result of the meat content , which gives rise to phosphoric and sulphuric acids , i.e. , to metabolic acidosis .
in the short term , metabolic acids are buffered by tissue proteins and bicarbonate ( the <unk> reserve ' ) .
in the longer term , acid must be excreted , or neutralized with base which is also generated from the diet , by conversion of dietary <unk> to ammonia .
the final steps of this process occur in the kidney , which converts circulating glutamine to ammonia , and to carbon products such as glucose and carbon dioxide , by metabolic reactions which adapt during acidosis to generate more ammonia and maintain an increased renal ammonia content .
the complex mechanisms which govern the formation of ammonia , glucose and carbon dioxide from glutamine , involving the reactions of amino acids , the tricarboxylic acid cycle , and gluconeogenesis , are reviewed .
studies on the mechanism of the changes in serum and liver <unk> <unk> activity .
i. experimental <unk> cholestasis in rabbits .
serum , liver and renal <unk> <unk> ( ggt ) activities were studied in four groups of rabbits : controls , rabbits with obstructive <unk> cholestasis , rabbits with obstructive <unk> , and animals with combined obstructive <unk> cholestasis and obstructive <unk> .
serum ggt was essentially increased in rabbits with obstructive <unk> cholestasis , showing peak values in the combined cholestasis + obstructive <unk> group , and practically normal values in animals with <unk> .
liver ggt was increased in both cholestasis groups , but the increase was less prominent than the increase in serum ggt and there was no correlation between them .
in both <unk> groups renal ggt was reduced , probably as a result of inhibited enzyme synthesis secondary to the altered conditions for adequate renal function .
the results obtained are suggestive of a probable renal involvement in the formation of the serum ggt activity level .
studies on the mechanism of the changes in serum and liver <unk> <unk> activity .
ii .
experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits .
the mechanism responsible for the changes in serum and liver <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) activity was studied in a model of experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits .
porphyria followed the administration of hexachlorobenzene in doses of 280 <unk> - <unk> body weight , which were given daily through a gastric tube over a 20-day period .
serum <unk> activity and the activities of the lysosomal enzymes <unk> and <unk> were increased , whereas <unk> : 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and l-alanine : 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and l-alanine : 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered .
there was a considerable increase in liver microsomal protein , <unk> , cytochrome p-450 , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> acid synthase .
in the liver <unk> was detected in the <unk> as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher .
the high correlation coefficient between liver <unk> , cytochrome p-450 and <unk> acid synthase witnesses a <unk> <unk> formation in the liver .
a statistically significant correlation between serum and liver <unk> activity was also found .
these data strongly suggest that the increase in serum <unk> activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver .
changes in erythrocyte 2,3 <unk> in women following short term maximal exercise .
15 untrained women were subjected to a walking treadmill test to determine the influence of maximal exercise upon synthesis of erythrocyte 2,3 dpg .
although there was a 9.8 % increase in the 2,3 dpg content following exercise , there was a concomitant 9.4 % increase in the hemoglobin level ; therefore , when 2,3 dpg is expressed as a ratio to hemoglobin ( see article ) , there was no significant change as a result of exercise stress .
it was suggested that three additive factors produced during strenuous exercise ; decreased ph ; increased hemoglobin concentration ; and increased co2 production result in by-product inhibition of 2,3 dpg synthesis .
it is concluded that 2,3 dpg does not provide a physiologic benefit in the adaptation of the oxygen transport system to exercise .
hydroxylation of <unk> acid by illuminated chloroplasts .
the role of superoxide .
1. chloroplasts isolated from leaves of <unk> ( beta vulgaris l. <unk> vulgaris ) do not catalyse the hydroxylation of <unk> acid in the dark unless a reductant ( such as ascorbate , nadh or nadph ) is added .
superoxide dismutase has no effect on this reaction .
2. illuminated chloroplasts catalyse the hydroxylation in the absence of added reductant .
this reaction is completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase , but catalase has little effect .
3. both hydroxylation in the light and hydroxylation in the dark in the presence of <unk> are inhibited by <unk> , edta , cyanide and <unk> .
<unk> it is proposed that <unk> generated by illuminated chloroplasts is involved in the provision of a reductant to the enzyme <unk> .
identification of <unk> sites in hemoglobin by <unk> <unk> studies of hemoglobin digests .
<unk> <unk> magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies indicate that various digests of human hemoglobin with carboxypeptidase a and b , or a combination of the two , may be used for the identification of chloride binding sites .
all the digestion products contain , like hemoglobin itself , at least two classes of binding sites , one of high , the others of low affinity .
the ph dependence of the excess linewidth of the <unk> minus nmr signal indicates that in the simple digests with either carboxypeptidase a or b , chloride is bound with high affinity at or near <unk> and at or near <unk> .
the high-affinity sites show , in the case of the simple digests , a strong oxygen linkage which is lost in the forms digested with both carboxypeptidase a and b ; this linkage may thus be correlated to the presence of conformational changes .
organic phosphates , like inositol <unk> , show competition for some of the high-affinity chloride binding sites in hemoglobin and in the simple digests .
this competition is likewise lost in the doubly digested hemoglobins .
the <unk> ph gradient , sensitive to <unk> and atpase inhibitor , in growing clostridium <unk> .
1. the intracellular ph was measured in growing clostridium <unk> with and acid-base equilibrium distribution method .
[ 14c ] <unk> , [ 14 ] methylamine and [ 14c ] acetic acid were used as `` <unk> '' .
during growth the extracellular ph decreased from 7.1 to 5.1 ; simultaneously the intracellular ph changed from 7.5 to 5.9 .
thus , the intracellular ph was more alkaline than the extracellular ph by 0.4 to 0.8 <unk> .
2. this ph gradient ( interior alkaline ) was abolished by the proton conductor <unk> <unk> and the atpase inhibitor n , <unk> .
the ph gradient could not be demonstrated in cells depleted of an energy substrate .
these results suggest that the ph gradient is formed by an <unk> extrusion of protons from the cells rather than by a donnan potential .
3. growth of the organism was inhibited by low concentrations of both <unk> <unk> ( 5 mum ) and <unk> ( 5 mum ) .
this finding suggests that the ph gradient is essential for the growing cell as it may be required for substrate accumulation and other types of transport processes .
<unk> carboxypeptidase in the bacterial form and <unk> of proteus mirabilis .
membranes of the bacterial form and the stable and unstable <unk> of proteus mirabilis contain ld and <unk> .
the <unk> is inhibited <unk> by penicillin g .
the enzyme of the bacterial form is highly <unk> ( ki - 4 x 10 ( -9 ) m penicillin g ) .
inhibition is only partly reversible by treatment with <unk> or by dialysis against buffer .
in contrast , the <unk> of the unstable <unk> , grown in the presence of penicillin , is <unk> less <unk> ( ki = 7 x 10 ( 7 ) m penicillin g ) .
inhibition is completely reversed by <unk> or dialysis .
after inhibition by penicillin and subsequent reactivation the penicillin sensitivity of the bacterial <unk> is similar to the sensitivity of the enzyme of the unstable <unk> .
the hypothesis is proposed that p. mirabilis contains two <unk> of different penicillin sensitivity and with different mechanisms of penicillin binding .
peptidoglycan synthesis in the cell walls of the unstable <unk> is probably carried out with the help of only one <unk> , viz. the completely <unk> enzyme with the lower penicillin sensitivity .
<unk> nad kinase .
the structural and kinetic basis of regulation of nadph .
nad kinase was purified from pigeon liver by an improved procedure which included chromatography on <unk> .
the resultant preparation was homogeneous as judged by gel electrophoresis , but <unk> gave indications of heterogeneity .
the enzyme appeared to be of molecular weight <unk> , and to consist of subunits of molecular weight <unk> ; it may therefore be an <unk> .
kinetic studies over a wide range of substrate concentrations revealed departures from michaelis-menten behaviour with the substrate <unk> ; these were interpreted tentatively in terms of negative <unk> interactions between identical binding sites , since thermal and chemical inactivation studies revealed no evidence for more than one type of catalytic site .
the significance of the kinetics and of the type of inhibition produced by nadph is discussed in terms of the regulation of nad kinase activity in vivo .
hydrogen ion changes and contractile behavior in the perfused rat heart .
the effect of acid-base alterations was analyzed using isolated rat hearts perfused at constant coronary perfusion pressure , and stimulated to contract at constant rat .
the amount of shortening in the major axis and its derivative were measured to assess myocardial contractility .
both the <unk> ' and <unk> ' alterations affected the contractile behavior to the same extent .
in the physiological range studied by us , acidosis depresses and alkalosis increases myocardial contraction .
however acidosis seems to depress contractility more than the enhancement produced by the same change in ph towards the <unk> side .
when either amount of shortening or max <unk> was plotted as a function of hydrogen ion <unk> ( <unk> ) a linear correlation was obtained , either with pure <unk> ' or <unk> ' acid-base induced alterations ( correlation coefficients higher than <unk> ; p less than .01 ) .
our findings suggest that in the range studied by us , contraction of the perfused rat heart following acid-base alterations , is a linear function of hydrogen ion activity .
changes of eeg and pulmonary venous admixture during a protein load in patients with cirrhosis .
21 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and 24 control patients were studied before and after a protein load ( 120 g protein per day during one week ) .
an eeg was recorded and a visual assessment of frequency pattern was performed .
venous admixture was estimated during <unk> .
according to the eeg frequency pattern the patient group with cirrhosis was subdivided into those with eeg slowing after the protein load ( n = 7 ) and those without ( n = 14 ) .
the following results were obtained : 1 ) resting arterial blood gases did not change in either group .
2 ) there was a significant increase of the <unk> ( difference between alveolar <unk> and peripheral arterial <unk> ) in <unk> and controls .
3 ) the increase in <unk> was significantly larger in those <unk> showing eeg slowing compared to those without eeg - slowing or to the controls .
4 ) fractional venous <unk> increased significantly in those <unk> showing eeg slowing .
there was no significant change in those patients who did not show eeg changes or in the controls .

an evaluation of factors affecting the in vitro bioassay for erythropoietin .
two main aspects of the in vitro mouse foetal liver cell assay for erythroid stimulating factor ( esf ) in human sera have been investigated .
the haem extraction process has been shown to give specific and quantitative recovery of <unk> labelled haem from haemoglobin thus confirming that the material assayed in human sera is stimulating the synthesis of this protein .
the extraction procedure can be simplified considerably by prior mixing of the reagents without significantly influencing the results .
several serum constituents ( citrate , testosterone , b12 , folic acid and iron ) have been investigated over a range of concentrations for possible effects on the cultures .
generally only small effects on haem synthesis were observed .
it is concluded that variations in the levels of these factors in sera from treated patients will not produce any significant alterations in the estimated esf concentrations .

in white rats both adapted and <unk> to cold , the rq dynamics during cold exposure , noradrenaline and ganglion blocking agent administration , were studied .
the adapted animals ' rq in <unk> conditions was shown to be a little higher than in the control rats ; 0.5 mg/kg noradrenaline injections induced a clear rq decrease in the former and did not influence the latters ' rq .
cold exposure was followed by a rq decrease in both .
ganglion blocking agent administration decreased the rq in the adapted animals and prevented it from falling in the control those .

chromosomal basis of the <unk> in a partially <unk> mutant of pneumococcus .
a <unk> mutant of pneumococcus , <unk> , displays a genetic instability , regularly segregating to wild type .
dna extracts of derivatives of the strain possess transforming activities for both the mutant and wild-type alleles , establishing that the strain is a partial diploid .
the linkage of <unk> to <unk> , a stable chromosomal marker , was established , thus defining a chromosomal locus for <unk> .
dna isolated from <unk> cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wild-type recipient , although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating classical `` <unk> '' donor markers equally as efficiently as `` high efficiency '' markers .
hence <unk> must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations .
we suggest that the dna in the region of the <unk> mutation has a structural abnormality which leads both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently mediating genetic transformation .
recombination as a requirement for segregation of a partially diploid mutant of pneumococcus .
conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain <unk> , resistant to the drug sulfanilamide , gives rise to sensitive <unk> resistant to <unk> acid at a frequency constant with time .
this <unk> frequency is markedly enhanced upon exposure of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or <unk> c that permit survival of 50 % to 90 % of the cells .
treatment with acridine orange diminishes the <unk> frequency .
from the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination , we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of <unk> -- during a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or <unk> c , cell division resumes and the original <unk> frequency is restored .
thus potential <unk> are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection , or they are under-represented among the cells dividing soon after <unk> -- if the <unk> mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an atp-dependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming dna , <unk> frequencies are unaffected .
this fact may indicate limits upon the type of recombination event responsible for segregation .
[ <unk> effects of <unk> in patients with asthma and chronic asthmatic bronchitis ] .
involvement of the small intestine in systemic mast cell disease .
a patient is reported with mast cell infiltration of the small intestine in the absence of the skin involvement characteristic of mast cell disease .
she also had subtotal villous atrophy responsive to a gluten-free diet .
criteria for diagnosing mast cell disease of the small intestine are proposed .
the literature of small intestinal mast cell disease is reviewed and the relationship to coeliac disease is discussed .
gastric ph and microflora of normal and <unk> infants .
the microflora and ph of gastric contents were determined in breast-fed and in <unk> normal infants , in well nourished infants with acute diarrhoea and in infants with chronic diarrhoea and <unk> malnutrition .
the last group of infants was reevaluated after recovery from diarrhoea and <unk> malnutrition .
a bactericidal ph effect below 2-5 was observed .
<unk> controls had low ph values and low bacterial concentrations , whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and <unk> malnutrition had high ph values and bacterial overgrowth , essentially of gram-negative bacilli .
after recovery , the only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of <unk> fungi in low concentrations .
infants with acute diarrhoea , except for the isolation more frequently of <unk> fungi , presented no alterations ; this seems to indicate that ph alterations and gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state .
breast-fed normal infants had <unk> concentrations similar to those of the chronic diarrhoea group , but without gram-negative bacilli overgrowth , suggesting that other factors , besides ph , regulate bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants .

[ biphasic ( <unk> and <unk> ) effect of adrenaline in rats ] .
<unk> gastric ulceration was studied in rats .
adrenaline in high doses caused gastric ulcer , which was completely blocked by pretreatment with <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , but not by pretreatment with propranolol or atropine , nor by <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
after successive administration of adrenaline , once daily for 7 days , however , no gastric ulcer was observed .
recovery from the <unk> action of adrenaline was seen after 4 weeks withdrawal .
pretreatment with a small dose of adrenaline inhibited the <unk> action of a high dose of adrenaline .
pretreatment with reserpine , <unk> or <unk> inhibited the action of adrenaline .
it is concluded that adrenaline has a biphasic effect on gastric ulceration , the <unk> action is due to its <unk> and <unk> effect is due to development of <unk> .
[ comparison of drug effects on the isolated rat colon and duodenum ] .
adrenaline and <unk> elicited nearly maximal relaxation of the colon even in small doses , whereas increase in the doses caused greater relaxation in the duodenum .
in the colon , these drugs prevented , to a great extent the contraction induced by acetylcholine ( ach ) and serotonin but in the duodenum were totally ineffective .
<unk> and propranolol reduced <unk> and <unk> relaxation in the duodenum , though propranolol decreased the relaxation caused by <unk> .
atropine prevented <unk> contraction in both the colon and duodenum in the same way .
after <unk> acid diethylamide , duodenal contraction caused by ach or serotonin decreased by over 70 % ; however , the contraction of the colon was not significantly inhibited .
<unk> had similar effects , but to a lesser degree .
in <unk> bathing fluid without addition of <unk> , ach and prostaglandin e1 elicited contraction in the colon , but not in the duodenum .
[ monoamine oxidase ( xxxvi ) . characteristics of <unk> oxidase in the dog serum ] .
<unk> properties of monoamine oxidase ( mao ) in dog serum were studied and the following results were obtained .
some of <unk> properties of mao in dog serum differed from that of mitochondrial mao .
when dog serum was fractionated by ammonium sulfate , proteins were concentrated in two fractions , such as 25 approximately 33 % and 67 approximately 80 % of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction , while mao activity was concentrated in 40 approximately 50 % of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction .
the reaction rate of mao in dog serum was found to be proportional to enzyme concentration .
the optimum ph of mao in dog serum was 7.0 which differed from that of mao in rabbit serum ( ph 8.0 ) .
<unk> buffer strongly inhibited mao activity in dog serum .
when <unk> was used as substrate , the highest activity was obtained compared with the other substrate used .
the activities with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and tyramine showed about 30 % while tryptamine and serotonin showed 3 approximately 10 % compared to that with <unk> as substrate .
the value of <unk> of catron was about 3 x 10 ( -6 ) m and that of <unk> was about 3 x 10 ( -5 ) m , but <unk> did not inhibit mao activity in dog serum at the concentration of 1 x 10 ( -4 ) m .
[ combined use of <unk> and <unk> derivatives ( 1 ) . pharmacological activities and blood concentration ] .
a combination of two or more drugs may exert a <unk> interaction , in which case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized .
such synergistic effects are well known in the case of <unk> ( <unk> + <unk> ) or <unk> ( phenylbutazone + <unk> ) .
<unk> ( bcp ) , a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent , has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula of <unk> .
thus the influence of bcp combination on the pharmacological activities of various <unk> derivatives was examined .
bcp potentiated the analgesic and antipyretic effects of <unk> ( 4a ) , <unk> ( ma ) , <unk> ( am ) and <unk> ( ipa ) , which were substituted by the <unk> group at <unk> of the <unk> ring .
this potentiation occurred when the dose of bcp exceeded that of the <unk> , and was especially marked when combination ratio of bcp exceeded that of the <unk> , and was especially marked when combination ratio of bcp and <unk> was 2:1 mola .
the analgesic effects of <unk> ( an ) , <unk> ( ip ) and <unk> ( ap ) , which were substituted by alkyl group or <unk> group at <unk> , were not potentiated by bcp in any combination ratio .
most <unk> showed additive acute toxicity in their combination with bcp , but acute toxicities of 4a and am , which were potentiated in analgesic effects , were decreased and antagonized when combined with bcp .
the plasma concentration of am was increased and prolonged by bcp , while that of ip remained much the same .
these results suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular interactions between bcp and <unk> , which are substituted by the <unk> group at <unk> of the <unk> ring .
[ combined use of <unk> and <unk> derivatives ( ii ) . complex formation due to interaction between <unk> and <unk> ] .
we have already reported that <unk> ( bcp ) , a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent , potentiates significantly the analgesic and antipyretic effects of <unk> which are substituted by <unk> group at <unk> of the <unk> ring .
physical and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of this synergistic action .
the solubility of bcp was markedly increased in proportion to elevation of <unk> ( am ) concentration , but not by a combination with <unk> ( ip ) .
the binding of bcp to bovine serum albumin was slightly inhibited by am , but not by ip .
the mixture of am and bcp in aqueous media generated optical absorption in the ultraviolet differential spectrum , due to the charge transfer interaction .
the results of the infrared or nmr spectrum demonstrated the formation of a hydrogen binding in non-aqueous media between bcp and am .
from the calculation of the charge on an atom , the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the frontier electron density , bcp is considered to be a good electron acceptor .
the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> were found to correlate with the potentiation coefficient of analgesic activity in combination drugs .
these results suggest that the complex formation between bcp and <unk> is an important factor for the synergism of action and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen binding of both molecules .
fructose <unk> aldolase activity of rhizobium species .
fdp aldolase was found to be present in the cell-free extracts of rhizobium <unk> , rhizobium <unk> , rhizobium <unk> , rhizobium meliloti , rhizobium lupini , rhizobium japonicum and rhizobium species from arachis <unk> and sesbania <unk> .
the enzyme in 3 representative species has optimal activity at ph 8.4 in <unk> <unk> buffer .
the enzyme activity was completely lost by treatment at 60 degrees c for 15 min .
the km values were in the range from 2.38 to 4.55 x 10 ( -6 ) m fdp .
metal chelating agents inhibited enzyme activity , but monovalent or bivalent metal ions failed to stimulate the activity .
bivalent metal ions in general were rather inhibitory .
prevention of cell agglutination and competence in a genetically transformable strain of pneumococcus by <unk> and <unk> .
in the presence of amino sugars <unk> and <unk> no spontaneous competence could be observed in the highly transformable <unk> strain of pneumococcus or it was decreased by several orders of magnitude .
the highest inhibition of competence was detected when the amino sugar at a concentration 5 mg/ml of the medium was added not only to the transformation but also to the <unk> medium .
after a 150 min growth in the transformation medium in the presence of the amino sugar a 3 -- 4-fold greater number of cells ( as a viable count ) could be detected as compared with the control without the amino sugar .
it was found microscopically that the amino sugar prevents natural agglutination , which normally occurs in the competent culture .
the role of specific amino sugar determinants for binding of the competence factor on the cell surface and the resulting inhibitory effect of these sugars on the development of competence are discussed .
effect of some <unk> on growth of saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited with molybdenum .
the inhibitory effect of molybdenum ions on growth of yeasts at ph 5.5 was found to be decreased by <unk> in the following order : <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> .
increased concentrations of molybdenum brought about morphological changes of yeast cells .
cells grown under these conditions were smaller , had thicker walls and formed clusters .
transport properties of membrane vesicles from <unk> <unk> .
ii .
kinetic characteristics and specificity of glucose transport system .
the glucose transport system of membrane vesicles isolated from <unk> <unk> is saturable , with a km of 21.2 mum and v of 0.68 <unk> <unk> ( mg protein ) -1 .
the process is <unk> and a break occurs in the arrhenius plot at 15 degrees c .
exogenous substrates did not stimulate glucose transport probably due to their inability to penetrate into membrane vesicles .
<unk> and <unk> competitively inhibited glucose transport .
maltose inhibited transport of glucose <unk> .
these sugars also elicited glucose efflux from preloaded membrane vesicles .
transport of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> yeast .
<unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) were prepared by catalytic <unk> of the corresponding <unk> derivatives with gaseous tritium .
the two sugars are transported into saccharomyces cerevisiae by both the constitutive glucose and the inducible galactose carrier .
uranyl ions are powerful inhibitors .
the ph optimum in <unk> cells lies at 5.5 for both sugars , the apparent activation energies ( between 15 and 35 degrees c ) are 25.1 kj/mol and 16.5 kj/mol , respectively .
the steady-state intracellular concentration of both sugars is less than the extracellular one ( no uphill transport ) .
neither of them is a substrate of yeast hexokinase .
<unk> undergoes a <unk> conversion to an unknown metabolite which is not phosphorylated and may represent one of its oxidation products .
<unk> acid production by penicillium <unk> .
twenty-five penicillium species isolated from egyptian soil were examined for their ability to produce <unk> acid in surface culture .
of the eight species capable of producing <unk> acid , penicillium <unk> gave the maximum yield ( 91 % <unk> acid from glucose after 7 days of fermentation with 3 % caco3 ) .
peptone was the best nitrogen source for acid fermentation and glucose was superior to sucrose .
addition of low concentrations of <unk> and <unk> - 7 h2o stimulated acid production .
an initial ph of 6.1 was most favourable for acid accumulation and addition of caco3 was necessary for maximum acid production .
a simple method of isolation and purification of cultures of <unk> fungi .
a simple method of isolation and purification of cultures of higher fungi , mainly <unk> fungi , without special requirements for the presence of <unk> nutrients is described .
parts of fruiting bodies , spores or infected wood is inoculated on petri dishes with an agar medium of the following composition : 1.0 g <unk> , 0.2 g <unk> - 7 h2o , 0.1 g <unk> , 0.01 g fe2 ( so4 ) 3 , 10.0 g glucose , tap water to 1 litre ; 20.0 g agar .
this medium does not suit most of the contaminants but fungal hyphae overgrow the whole surface of the dish so that a purified culture can be obtained from parts distant from the inoculation site .

[ studies on low volume priming heart lung bypass ( <unk> transl ) ] .
this report concerns the feasibility of low volume priming extracorporeal circulation .
through this study , the bubble oxygenator with <unk> heat exchange was used .
moderate hypothermia with surface cooling and <unk> perfusion with 5 per cent <unk> was evaluated in 32 mongrel dogs and 16 clinical open heart cases .
the results obtained here were as follow : 1 ) body temperature reduction by surface cooling before bypass provided more even cooling than did core cooling by low flow partial bypass alone .
2 ) in regard to cardiac loading on returning the whole <unk> of the circuit to patient , approximately 20 <unk> of 5 per cent <unk> was feasible as a priming solution .
3 ) to reduce the blood <unk> , <unk> technique with 5 per cent <unk> was superior , and <unk> effect during postoperative periods was <unk> .
4 ) the excess lactate volume postulated by huckabee was a available index to evaluate metabolic acidosis during the extracorporeal circulation .
5 ) with aid of surface cooling , the acid-base balance during perfusion was kept to lesser extent than that of core cooling only .
6 ) this study indicated that the low priming perfusion in <unk> with surface cooling hypothermia was a reliable technique for the open heart operation and may be applied in more prolonged perfusion .
[ studies on extracorporeal circulation with large volume <unk> using lactate <unk> solution and low molecular weight dextran : alterations of acid-base balance associated with intentional <unk> ( <unk> transl ) ] .
twenty mongrel dogs , weighing between 7.5 and 13.0 kg were used to investigate the percentage limits permissible for <unk> using a <unk> reservoir heart-lung machine which has a 1,100 ml of priming volume .
in both 40 and 50 per cent groups of intentional <unk> by 30 minute extracorporeal circulation , remarkable anemia was inevitable and recovery was extremely slow , especially in the 50 per cent dilution group .
in both 40 and 50 per cent groups of intentional <unk> by 30 minute extracorporeal circulation , metabolic acidosis was observed .
in 50 per cent group of intentional <unk> , no improvement of metabolic acidosis was observed even after perfusion .
when sodium bicarbonate was administered to 40 per cent <unk> group , minimum alterations of acid-base balance and of serum electrolytes were observed during and after extracorporeal perfusion .
when sodium bicarbonate was administered to 50 per cent <unk> group , metabolic acidosis was more evident than in 40 per cent <unk> group accompanied with an increase in serum sodium concentration and a decrease in serum chloride concentration .
these data qualify the use of 40 per cent intentional <unk> using lactate <unk> solution or low molecular weight dextran for 30 minute extracorporeal circulation when sodium bicarbonate is administered in adequate amounts .
[ malignant rheumatoid arthritis ] .
purification and characterization of phosphodiesterase from crotalus venom .
a procedure for the purification of phosphodiesterase from crotalus venom on <unk> at alkaline ph is described .
the enzyme gives a single band in polyacrylamide gels and is free of contaminating <unk> enzymes .
the molecular weight is about <unk> .
concentration in an <unk> <unk> gave a highly concentrated active enzyme .
phosphodiesterase is relatively stable and can be stored at 4 degrees c in the presence of mg2 and serum albumin for years .
for the detection of contaminating endonuclease , an assay was used in which trna was the substrate and possible internal breaks were detected in polyacrylamide gel after denaturation .
with bis ( <unk> ) phosphate as substrate , 15mm mg2 was necessary for optimal activity .
the reaction remained linear for at least 15 min at 22 degrees c .
at 45 degrees c , the liberation of <unk> was highest within 25 min of incubation .
at 75 degrees c , inactivation of the enzyme occurred after 4 min .
limited hydrolysis of trna by phosphodiesterase .
digestion of trna by <unk> pure phosphodiesterase is limited to a short sequence of nucleotides at the <unk> .
on the average , four percent of all nucleotides can be released from trna .
the optimum mg2 concentration is 10mm and the optimum ph 9.2 .
the mode of action is a random attack by the enzyme on the substrate .
the terminal amp is completely removed at 15 degrees c after short incubation ; about 400 mol of amp were removed per min by 1 mol of enzyme .
the following cmp residues are released much more slowly ; at 15 degrees c incompletely , and at 37 degrees c more or less completely in 1 h .
in about 50 % of the trna molecules , the fourth nucleotide could be removed in very long <unk> or with very high enzyme concentrations .
<unk> oxidase , an enzyme from the blowfly calliphora <unk> ( meigen ) .
in the blowfly , the formation of <unk> from the insect molting hormone <unk> is catalyzed by an enzyme which carries hydrogen from <unk> and <unk> to oxygen .
the enzyme is therefore called `` <unk> oxidase '' .
two methods are described for the detection of <unk> oxidase activity , one using a <unk> substrate which is separated from the product by <unk> chromatography after the reaction , and the other using <unk> , which is discoloured by the redox reaction .
the <unk> oxidase is purified by a factor of 2200 from <unk> of calliphora <unk> using salt precipitation and ion exchange chromatography .
the <unk> oxidase has a km value for <unk> of <unk> .
the ph optimum is 6.5 .
the temperature optimum lies at 45 degrees c .
the <unk> oxidase has a molecular weight of <unk> .
using a hospital for desensitization of an <unk> <unk> fears .
an outpatient with phobias related to enclosed places , hospitals , doctors , and cancer was treated by systematic desensitization ; the facilities of a general hospital were used for part of the process .
steps in treatment included securing a complete psychiatric and social history , teaching the patient relaxation therapy techniques , and establishing a hierarchy of <unk> stimuli specifically related to the <unk> fears .
after desensitization the patient was able to enter the hospital for tests for a physical ailment and showed a general decrease in her fears .

analysis of immunosuppression generated by the graft-versus-host reaction .
i. a suppressor t-cell component studied in vivo .
the kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in ( <unk> x <unk> ) f1 mice during graft-versus-host ( <unk> ) reaction induced with spleen cells from either parental strain have been investigated .
effects on pfc responses to <unk> ( chicken red blood cells ) and independent ( levan ) antigens have been compared .
the unresponsive state which developed in <unk> mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients .
furthermore , <unk> spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system , but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the original donors ( or their cells ) were still totally refractory after 80 days .
this active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by t cells of <unk> origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by <unk> attack .
the delayed transfer of <unk> cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen , indicated that suppressor t cells exert an <unk> influence on <unk> b-cell proliferation .
supplementation of <unk> , <unk> <unk> spleen cells with purified normal t cells demonstrated that b cells in <unk> mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by t cells is no longer demonstrable .
the likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed .

pneumococcal <unk> variability in alternate complement pathway activation .
<unk> of streptococcus pneumoniae may be mediated by the alternate complement pathway .
to study the importance of this interaction to human disease , complement consumption by pneumococci of various serotypes was measured in <unk> serum chelated with <unk> acid , a substance that blocks the classic but not the alternate complement <unk> .
serotype i , in contrast to all other types studied , lacked ability to consume complement in this system .
the ability for serotypes iii , iv , and viii to activate the alternate pathway could be eliminated by prior serum absorption at o c with they type in question , a condition that would remove antibody but not complement .
types vii , xii , xiv , and xxv readily activated the alternate pathway in <unk> and absorbed sera .
differences could not be related to properties of the capsules .
it was concluded that types i , iii , iv , and viii lack intrinsic ability to activate and thus be <unk> by the alternate complement pathway , although types iii , iv , and viii can do so in concert with specific antibody .
the fact that these same types are especially prominent in human disease suggests that the ability to evade <unk> by the alternate complement pathway in <unk> phases of infection may be a virulence factor in pneumococci .
conditions for production , and some characteristics , of mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor produced by spleen cells from mice immunized with viable cells of the attenuated <unk> strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis .
mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor ( <unk> ) , found in supernatant fluids of mouse spleen cell cultures that have been stimulated in vitro with homologous antigen , inhibited the intracellular multiplication of virulent tubercle bacilli within normal mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro .
<unk> stimulated <unk> mouse spleen cells required 72 h of incubation to produce supernatant fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition .
supernatant fluids from <unk> mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular inhibition .
investigation of the culture conditions showed that at lease 1.0 % human serum was required in the tissue culture medium for the production of <unk> by spleen cells from immunized mice .
<unk> activity was noted only in supernatant fluids from spleen cell cultures incubated with antigen for 72 h .
<unk> was <unk> and unaffected by freezing , <unk> , or incubation at 60 c for 30 min .
however , <unk> was inactivated after incubation at 80 c for 30 min .
<unk> was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations ( ph 7 to 12 ) , but exposure to higher hydrogen ion concentrations ( ph 6 , ph 5 ) significantly decrease <unk> activity , and exposure to ph 4 to 2 abolished all activity .
supernatant fluids diluted 1:32 were still able to produce significant intracellular inhibition of growth of virulent tubercle bacilli .
effect of pneumococci on blood clotting , platelets , and polymorphonuclear leukocytes .
infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae and products from the organism have been associated with alterations in blood clotting and function of platelets .
pneumococci and pneumococcal polysaccharide shortened the clotting times of whole blood , <unk> plasma ( prp ) , and <unk> plasma ( ppp ) in vitro .
clotting times of ppp and prp from <unk> animals were likewise decreased .
the bacteria had no effect on the <unk> prothrombin time or the partial thromboplastin time when the organisms were used as activating agents .
platelets aggregated in the presence of pneumococci , but aggregation was prevented by the addition of cyclic adenosine 3 ' , <unk> ( camp ) .
furthermore , camp corrected the shortened clotting time of prp in the presence of pneumococci .
the clumping and release of polymorphonuclear coagulant that was induced by pneumococci was not prevented by camp .
thus , pneumococci exert several dose-dependent <unk> effects : ( i ) release of platelet <unk> substances ; ( ii ) a direct <unk> effect ; and ( iii ) release of polymorphonuclear coagulant .
some properties of a d-alanine carboxypeptidase in envelope fractions of neisseria gonorrhoeae .
envelope preparations of neisseria gonorrhoeae strain <unk> ( a stable , <unk> strain of intermediate colony morphology ) and type t1 possess a d-alanine carboxypeptidase which releases the terminal alanine residue from the uridine <unk> <unk> substrate ( isolated from bacillus cereus t ) .
the d-alanine carboxypeptidase of the <unk> envelopes has a broad ph optimum between ph 8.0 to 10.0 .
when the <unk> of the tris ( hydroxymethyl ) <unk> buffer was varied , the activity showed an optimum over the range 0.2 to 0.4 m .
activity was higher ( 135 % of control level ) when 20 to 80 mm <unk> was present .
the km for the enzyme was 0.25 mm .
the d-alanine carboxypeptidase was inhibited by several beta-lactam antibiotics and the 50 % inhibitory levels were 10 ( -8 ) m penicillin g , 10 ( -8 ) m ampicillin , 10 ( -5 ) m <unk> , and 5 x 10 ( -7 ) m methicillin .
phenomenon of <unk> hemolysis : <unk> lysis of <unk> erythrocytes .
staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase c specific for sphingomyelin ( <unk> ) .
erythrocytes with approximately 50 % sphingomyelin in their membranes , e.g. , from sheep , have been shown to have up to 60 % of this phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at 37 c in isotonic buffered saline without hemolysis .
cooling of sphingomyelinase <unk> erythrocytes to 4 c causes complete lysis of the cells , a phenomenon known as <unk> hemolysis .
the addition of <unk> ( edta ) to sheep erythrocytes <unk> with sphingomyelinase c was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 c .
the treated cells became susceptible to <unk> hemolysis and to <unk> hemolysis simultaneously , and the degree of lysis of both mechanisms increased equally with prolonged <unk> with sphingomyelinase c .
erythrocytes of species not readily susceptible to <unk> hemolysis were equally <unk> to <unk> lysis .
<unk> of the edta series were the most effective , whereas <unk> more specific for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were without effect .
the rate of <unk> lysis was dependent on the <unk> period with <unk> and on the concentration of <unk> added .
the optimal concentration of edta was found to equal the amount of exogenously added <unk> , a cation necessary for sphingomyelinase c activity .
<unk> increased the rate of <unk> hemolysis , whereas increasing the osmotic pressure to twice isotonic completely inhibited <unk> lysis .
the data suggest that exogenously added and/or membrane-bound divalent cations are important for the stability of <unk> membranes .
the phenomenon of <unk> hemolysis may be a consequence of the temperature dependence of divalent ion stabilization .
host defense against the pneumococcus in <unk> , nude mice .
resistance to pneumococcal infection was tested in <unk> , nude ( <unk> ) mice .
pneumococcal serum <unk> activity , in vivo phagocytosis of the pneumococcus , and the mean lethal dose for the pneumococcus were all found to be the same in nude mice as in control ( <unk> ) mice .
t-lymphocytes do not appear to play a significant role in the <unk> defense against the pneumococcus .

in vitro antagonism of the mediators of allergy by a <unk> carboxylic acid <unk> .
<unk> was tested on isolated guinea pig ileum and rat stomach strips for activity against mediators probably released after allergen antibody union .
it antagonized the response produced by histamine , bradykinin , serotonin , prostaglandin e2 , prostaglandin <unk> and <unk> substance of anaphylaxis ( <unk> ) .
the concentrations which blocked 50 % of the response were 150 , 145 , 92 , 70 , 47 , and 32 <unk> , respectively .
this compound may be useful in the treatment of allergic conditions .
tyrosine aminotransferase induction in normal and <unk> chickens .
tyrosine aminotransferase ( tat ) induction by glucagon and dexamethasone in the liver of <unk> chickens was studied and compared with induction in healthy animals .
the transplantable tumor was caused by inoculation of cells from a cell line induced by <unk> avian <unk> virus .
tat was hardly detectable in tumor tissue of control and <unk> chickens , but it was induced by glucagon to levels which were significant although very low when compared to those in host liver or the liver of <unk> controls after glucagon treatment .
dexamethasone failed to induce tat in host liver at 8 a.m. while it significantly <unk> tat in the normal liver at the same time of the day .
similar failure of tat induction was not detectable when glucagon was used instead of dexamethasone .
furthermore , it was found that diurnal variations in basal and dexamethasone or <unk> tat levels are considerably mitigated in host liver as compared to those observed in the liver of healthy animals .
the possible reasons for these findings are discussed .
a behavior modification training program for staff working with drug addicts .
this paper described a behavior modification training program , emphasizing self-control , for staff working with drug addicts .
the program , which is primarily geared toward the training of paraprofessionals , takes place in ten 1-1/2 hour sessions and includes an overview of behavior modification as well as instruction in techniques of relaxation , desensitization , self-image improvement , behavior analysis , behavior control , assertive training , rational thinking , and how to set up and run similar behavior modification training programs for staff and patients .
since this training began at the new jersey neuropsychiatric institute in november 1971 , a total of 898 staff members , mostly paraprofessionals working with addicts , alcoholics , mentally ill patients , and inmates , including 53 from our own institution , 576 persons from other facilities in new jersey , and 269 from facilities in other states , have been trained , while 2,021 patients have been trained in similar programs .
most of this training has been accomplished by paraprofessionals .
preliminary evaluation data have been promising and the response of participants enthusiastic .
a kinetic study of the hydrolysis of <unk> <unk> methyl ester .
hydrolysis rates of <unk> <unk> methyl ester ( methyl <unk> ) and related model compounds were measured in aqueous , organic and mixed aqueous media .
adding <unk> ( dmso ) to water , retarded hydrolysis of the ester by a factor of 2 to 500 , depending on the ph of the medium and concentration of dmso .
ethanol also slowed hydrolysis , but the effect was not so pronounced .
related studies show that the <unk> group c-n bond of sodium <unk> is hydrolyzed only about <unk> as fast as the ester group c-o bond .

computer evaluation of the effect of <unk> on the spontaneous activity of smooth muscle from the urinary bladder of the rabbit .
the spontaneous activity exhibited in vitro by smooth muscle strips from the urinary bladder of the rabbit under the influence of <unk> in concentrations from 0.3 to 30 mum has been characterized in terms of three parameters : mean tension , frequency of contraction , and contractile deviation , all obtained by computer an <unk> .
while mean tension and frequency monotonically increased with concentration , the contractile deviation rose to a peak in the vicinity of 3.0 to 6.0 mum and thereafter decreased .
at concentrations less than 10 mum the contractile patterns were almost periodic , while at 10 and 30 mum , the patterns became highly erratic .
histologic examination of a limited number of tissues showed longitudinally oriented muscle bundles with multiple anastomosing .
characteristics of the <unk> form of a nuclear <unk> virus .
<unk> virions of a nuclear <unk> virus of the alfalfa looper , <unk> californica , found in the medium of cell cultures of infected fall armyworm , <unk> <unk> , and in the hemolymph of infected s. <unk> larvae were partially characterized by biological , chemical and physical methods .
also , the rate of appearance of the virions was studied in cell culture and the host insect to determine maximum virion production .
virions obtained from both sources were heat-sensitive , <unk> and inactivated by several organic solvents .
the <unk> virions found in the insect cell culture fluid and in the hemolymph were identical , and both were enveloped <unk> .
visualization of the <unk> enveloped nucleocapsid was accomplished only after fixation with glutaraldehyde .
differences between the <unk> and occluded virions of nuclear <unk> viruses are discussed .
degradation of <unk> virion rna by <unk> .
extensively degraded rna was isolated from virions of influenza virus which had been oxidized with sodium <unk> .
similarly , although to a lesser extent , rna isolated from <unk> ribonucleoprotein of influenza virus was also degraded .
in contrast , influenza virus rna , if first freed from other virion components , was not degraded by <unk> oxidation .
failure of rubella virus to replicate in mosquitos .
rubella virus failed to replicate in mosquitoes ( aedes albopictus and culex <unk> ) following parenteral inoculation .
the virus demonstrated in mosquitoes tested immediately after inoculation but was not detected in insects sampled 7 , 14 and 21 days <unk> .
this experiment provides further evidence that rubella is not an arbovirus , but does not invalidate its classification as a <unk> .
treatment of severe hypertension with minoxidil .
minoxidil in daily doses of 6 to 40 mg was administered to 11 patients with severe hypertension .
two patients died of causes unrelated to the drug and one patient withdrew from the study .
blood pressure was controlled in the remaining eight subjects , who received the drug for periods ranging from 5 to 40 months .
in three patients minoxidil could subsequently be replaced by conventional antihypertensive therapy .
adverse effects of minoxidil included fluid retention ( as assessed by edema and plasma volume studies ) , nonspecific ecg changes , hypertrichosis and conjunctival redness .
concomitant administration of diuretic and beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulted in excellent tolerance of the treatment and high patient compliance .

acute renal failure .
acute renal failure is a life-threatening situation for which satisfactory treatment is currently available .
death is usually related to concomitant infection rather than uremia .
prompt recognition and treatment of underlying factors that predispose to renal insufficiency can frequently prevent the development of intrinsic acute renal failure .

local control of pulmonary resistance and lung compliance in the canine lung .
local control of pulmonary resistance and lung compliance was studied in the in situ left lower lobe of the canine lung .
recirculation of blood through the lobe while the pco2 of the ventilatory gas was varied resulted in an increase in resistance and a decrease in compliance only when the pulmonary venous ph was greater than 7.42 .
alternating sodium bicarbonate and lactic acid infusion while alveolar pco2 was maintained below 5 mmhg demonstrated the dependence of the <unk> response on the acid-base status of the blood <unk> the respiratory airways .
the increase in resistance and decrease in compliance observed at a pulmonary venous ph of 7.64 was comparable to that observed after lobar pulmonary artery occlusion .
varying degrees of hypoxia did not significantly affect <unk> tone , nor was the bronchoconstriction following lobar pulmonary artery occlusion affected by the hypoxia .
vagal stimulation superimposed on a stepwise increase in pulmonary venous ph from 7.32 to 7.62 resulted in an increase in resistance which paralleled the increase in resistance when pulmonary venous ph alone was increased .
compliance was not significantly affected by vagal stimulation at any level of pulmonary venous ph .
analysis of pesticides by chemical <unk> .
i. a new procedure for the formation of <unk> esters of ten herbicidal acids .
a new esterification procedure was developed to form <unk> esters for 10 common herbicidal acids , using <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this reagent was found to be more desirable than the commonly used boron <unk> reagent .
maximum esterification was given for <unk> at a lower reaction temperature with a shorter reaction time .
also , maximum esterification of <unk> and <unk> was achieved .
the boron <unk> gave poor or little esterification with these 2 acids under the various conditions investigated .
the effect of solvents on esterification with the 2 reagents was also explored .
irreversible drug induced parkinsonism ( two case reports ) .
inactivation of citrate lyase from <unk> <unk> by a specific deacetylase and inhibition of this inactivation by <unk> ( <unk> .
a previously unrecognized enzyme , citrate lyase deacetylase , has been purified about <unk> from cell extracts of <unk> <unk> .
it catalyzed the conversion of enzymatically active <unk> lyase into the inactive <unk> and acetate .
the enzyme exhibited an optimal rate of inactivation at ph 8.1 .
because of the instability of <unk> lyase at acidic and alkaline ph values , all assays were carried out at ph 7.2 , where the spontaneous hydrolysis of the <unk> lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed 70 % of the activity at ph 8.1 .
the apparent km value for citrate lyase was 10 ( -7 ) m at ph 7.2 and 30 c .
the activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the citrate lyase from r. <unk> .
the corresponding lyases from enterobacter <unk> ( formerly klebsiella <unk> ) and streptococcus <unk> were not <unk> ; likewise , <unk> such as <unk> coenzyme a , <unk> coenzyme a , and <unk> were also not hydrolyzed .
citrate lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of r. <unk> grown with acetate or succinate ; it was induced by citrate along with the citrate lyase .
<unk> ( + ) <unk> strongly inhibited the deacetylase .
fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 1.4 x 10 ( -4 ) <unk> ( + ) <unk> .
<unk> ( - ) <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( - ) <unk> , and other metabolites were less effective .
novel type of <unk> <unk> in escherichia coli .
the purification and properties of a novel type of <unk> <unk> from escherichia coli are described .
the purified enzyme appears as a single band on sodium dodecyl <unk> gels and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 65,000 as estimated by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis .
it degrades pure <unk> <unk> from e. coli almost completely into low-molecular-weight products .
the two prominent <unk> fragments in the digest are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> acid and the corresponding <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the unique feature of these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and that the <unk> acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 <unk> linkage .
the new lytic enzyme is designated as a <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
its possible role in the rearrangement of <unk> during cell growth and division is discussed .
formation and cleavage of <unk> by <unk> aldolase of aspergillus niger .
<unk> aldolase of aspergillus niger , an enzyme that has not been reported previously , was purified <unk> .
maximal activity was obtained at ph 8.0 and 50 c .
the enzyme exhibited relative stereochemical specificity with respect to glyceraldehyde .
the km values for <unk> , glyceraldehyde , and pyruvate were 10 , 13.3 , and 3.0 mm , respectively .
the effects of some compounds and inhibitors on enzyme activity were examined .
stability of the enzyme under different conditions was investigated .
the equilibrium constant was about 0.33 x 10 ( -3 ) m .
chemotaxis of a motile streptococcus toward sugars and amino acids .
a motile streptococcus was isolated and its chemotactic behavior toward sugars and amino acids was studied .
motility was optimal in the presence of an exogenous energy source and a nonionic detergent , e.g. , tween 80 or <unk> .
both glucose and pyruvate could serve as energy source .
chemotaxis toward leucine was optimal at ph 7 to 8.5 and a temperature between 30 and 37 c .
the streptococcus showed a chemotactic response toward a variety of sugars .
all commonly occurring <unk> acids , except alanine , asparagine , aspartate , glutamate , arginine , and lysine , were attractants .
from concentration response curves the thresholds , peak concentrations , and optimal responses were determined .
phospholipase d activity of gram-negative bacteria .
a phospholipase hydrolyzing <unk> to <unk> acid and <unk> glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in preparations of gram-positive bacteria , saccharomyces cerevisiae , and rat liver mitochondria .
in cell-free extracts of escherichia coli , salmonella typhimurium , proteus vulgaris , and <unk> aeruginosa , this <unk> enzyme had similar ph and <unk> requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded <unk> glycerol and <unk> ethanolamine as substrates .
pyridine <unk> oxidation of methanol in <unk> yeasts .
an alcohol dehydrogenase linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and requiring glutathione has been isolated and partially purified from two <unk> yeasts .
it differs from previously described <unk> enzymes in ph optima , electron acceptor specificity , substrate specificity , inhibition pattern , and stability .
expression of the hut operons of salmonella typhimurium in klebsiella <unk> and in escherichia coli .
the normal hut ( histidine utilization ) operons , as well as those with mutations affecting the regulation of their expression , of salmonella typhimurium were introduced on an f ' <unk> into cells of s. typhimurium and klebsiella <unk> whose chromosomal hut genes had been deleted and into cells of escherichia coli , whose chromosome does not carry hut genes .
the <unk> hut operons respond in a manner very similar to induction and <unk> repression in all three organisms .
the small differences found reflect both different abilities to take up inducers from the medium and different degrees of <unk> repression exerted by glucose .
regulation of the hut operons of salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella <unk> by the heterologous hut repressors .
in <unk> strains of klebsiella <unk> with chromosomal hut genes of k. <unk> and <unk> hut genes of salmonella typhimurium , the repressor of either species can regulate the hut operons of the other species .
the repression exerted by the homologous repressor on the left-hand hut operon is , in both organisms , stronger than that exerted by the heterologous repressor .
transport of molybdate by clostridium <unk> .
the transport of <unk> into <unk> cells of clostridium <unk> was investigated .
transport of molybdate in this organism is energy dependent ; sucrose is required in the minimal media , and the system is inhibited by the glycolysis inhibitors , naf , <unk> acid , and arsenate .
the cells accumulate molybdate against a concentration gradient , and the uptake shows a marked dependence on temperature ( optimum 37 c ) and ph ( optimum 6.0 ) .
the rate of molybdate uptake with increasing molybdate concentrations shows saturation kinetics with an apparent km and vmax of 4.8 x 10 ( -5 ) m and 55 <unk> of dry cells per min , respectively .
inhibition studies with the anions <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> show that <unk> and <unk> competitively inhibit <unk> uptake ( apparent ki [ <unk> ] is 3.0 x 10 ( -5 ) m ; apparent ki [ <unk> ] is 2.4 x 10 ( -5 ) , whereas <unk> and <unk> have no inhibitory effect .
exchange experiments with <unk> show that only a small percentage of the <unk> taken up by the cells is exchangeable .
exchange experiments with <unk> and <unk> indicate that once inside the cells <unk> and <unk> can not substitute for <unk> .
<unk> acid <unk> synthase mutants of salmonella typhimurium .
the first committed step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in salmonella typhimurium was shown to be catalyzed by three isoenzymes of <unk> acid <unk> ( dahp ) synthase .
mutations in each of the genes specifying the isoenzymes were isolated and mapped .
<unk> , the structural gene for the <unk> isoenzyme , was linked to gal , and <unk> , the structural gene for the <unk> isoenzyme , was linked to <unk> .
<unk> , the structural gene for the <unk> isoenzyme , was linked to <unk> and tyra , which specify the <unk> and <unk> <unk> enzymes , respectively .
the <unk> isoenzyme was the predominant dahp synthase in wild-type cells , and only the <unk> isoenzyme was completely repressed , as well as inhibited , by low levels of its allosteric effector .
the dahp synthase isoenzymes were separated by chromatography on <unk> with a phosphate gradient which contained <unk> phosphate to protect the otherwise unstable <unk> isoenzyme .
no <unk> of either the <unk> or <unk> isoenzyme was observed at inhibitor concentrations up to 1 mm .
the <unk> isoenzyme was partially purified from extracts of a strain lacking the other two isoenzymes and shown to be inhibited about 30 % by 1 mm tryptophan .
a preliminary study of interference by tryptophan in the <unk> assay for dahp suggested a combined effect of tryptophan and <unk> <unk> , or an <unk> compound resulting from degradation of <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
membrane location of a <unk> implicated in the genetic transformation of <unk> pneumoniae .
the cellular localization of enzymes in <unk> pneumoniae was examined by fractionation of <unk> .
a <unk> implicated in the entry of deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) into the cell during genetic transformation was located in the cell membrane .
this enzyme , the major endonuclease of the cell ( endonuclease i ) , which is necessary for the conversion of donor dna to single strands inside the cell and oligonucleotides outside , thus could act at the cell surface .
another enzyme , the cell wall <unk> ( <unk> ) , was also found in the membrane fraction .
other enzymes , including <unk> , two <unk> , and adenosine <unk> <unk> , and a restriction type endonuclease , were located in the cytosol within the cell .
none of the enzymes examined were predominantly periplasmic in location .
<unk> were obtained spontaneously on incubation of pneumococcal cells in concentrated sugar solutions .
the <unk> enzyme appears to be involved in this process .
cells that were physiologically competent to take up dna formed <unk> sensitive <unk> two to three times faster than cells that were not in the competent state .
although some genetically incompetent mutants also formed <unk> more slowly , other such mutants formed them at the faster rate .
regulation of <unk> synthase during growth and sporulation of bacillus cereus .
a <unk> to sixfold increase in specific activity of <unk> acid synthase was observed during sporulation of bacillus cereus .
the enzyme from cells harvested before and after the increase in specific activity appeared to be very similar as judged by ph optima , heat denaturation kinetics , apparent michaelis constants , chromatography on <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
studies with various combinations of amino acids and one of the enzyme substrates , pyruvate , failed to give evidence for control of the enzyme by activation , inhibition , repression , induction , or stabilization .
omission of calcium from the sporulation medium had no significant effect on the specific activity pattern of the enzyme as a function of age of culture .
<unk> dehydrogenase of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> dehydrogenase has been purified to near homogeneity from <unk> <unk> .
as isolated , the enzyme contains <unk> adenine dinucleotide and a tightly bound metal cofactor .
inactivation by <unk> occurs in two steps and is partially blocked by <unk> .
reactivation by divalent metal ions occurs , with divalent zinc being the most effective .
when ferricyanide is used as the electron acceptor , <unk> has an apparent <unk> of 3.3 <unk> ; its binding is negatively cooperative with a hill coefficient of 0.46 .
replacement of ferricyanide by the other components of the electron transport system yields hyperbolic kinetics with an apparent km for <unk> of 26 mm .
the apparent km for ferricyanide is 2.2 x 10 ( -4 ) m .
phosphate and pyrophosphate compounds stimulate the <unk> : ferricyanide activity .
these properties suggest that interaction of this enzyme with other electron transport proteins in the chain may enhance <unk> binding and , hence , the rate of electron transport .
purification , new assay , and properties of coenzyme a transferase from <unk> <unk> .
coenzyme a ( coa ) transferase from <unk> <unk> has been purified and crystallized , and some of its properties have been established .
the work was facilitated by a newly developed coupled and continuous spectrophotometric assay in which the disappearance of added acrylate could be followed at 245 nm .
the rate-limiting conversion of <unk> and <unk> coa to <unk> coa by coa transferase was followed by the <unk> conversion to <unk> coa by excess <unk> .
thus , a small priming quantity of acetyl coa served to generate <unk> coa , which , by hydration , generated <unk> coa .
this product then served to generate more <unk> coa in cyclic fashion .
the net result was the coa <unk> conversion of acrylate to <unk> .
the purified transferase has a molecular weight of 125,000 and is composed of two subunits of 63,000 each , as determined by disc gel electrophoresis .
<unk> <unk> acids are substrates , whereas dicarboxylic or <unk> acids are not .
the reaction kinetics are typical of a ping-pong bi bi mechanism composed of two half reactions linked by a covalent enzyme intermediate .
incubation of the transferase with acetyl coa in the absence of a fatty acid acceptor yielded a stable intermediate which , by absorption spectrophotometry , radioactivity measurements , reduction with borohydride , reactivity with hydroxylamine , and catalytic activity , was identified as an <unk> compound .
kinetic constants for coa transferase are : final specific activity , 110 <unk> of protein corresponding to 1.38 x 10 ( 4 ) <unk> of acrylate activated per <unk> of transferase ; km for acrylate , 1.2 x 10 ( -3 ) m ; km for acetyl coa ( <unk> coa ) , 2.4 x 10 ( -5 ) m .
isolation and purification of <unk> <unk> , insoluble , sticky glucan of streptococcus mutans .
studies were made on the physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides synthesized by cell-free extracts of streptococcus mutans , streptococcus <unk> , and streptococcus sp. and their susceptibilities to <unk> .
among the polysaccharides examined , insoluble <unk> were rather resistant to available <unk> preparations , and the insoluble , sticky glucan produced by s. mutans <unk> 176 , which could be important in formation of dental plaques , was the most resistant .
by enrichment culture of soil specimens , using <unk> 176 <unk> as the sole carbon source , an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the <unk> 176 glucan .
the organism was identified as a strain of <unk> and named the <unk> bacterium .
<unk> bacterium was grown in <unk> soy broth , and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the <unk> 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a <unk> ( <unk> ) column and gradient elution chromatography with a <unk> ( <unk> ) column .
the enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of ph 8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000 .
its optimum ph was 6.3 and its optimal temperature was 42 c .
the purified enzyme released 11 % of the total glucose residues of the <unk> 176 glucan as reducing sugars and <unk> about half of the substrate glucan .
the products were found to be <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , with some oligosaccharides .
the purified enzyme split the <unk> <unk> and was inactive toward <unk> containing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and/or <unk> bonds as the main linkages .
production , purification , and characterization of an extracellular <unk> from streptomyces .
the synthesis by streptomyces sp. no. 6 of an extracellular <unk> was induced by glucosamine .
the enzyme was purified to homogeneity by <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> chromatography .
the purified enzyme hydrolyzed chitosan ( the <unk> polymer of glucosamine ) but not chitin nor <unk> .
the only products of the hydrolysis detectable by paper chromatography were <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> chromatography and sodium dodecyl <unk> gel electrophoresis indicated that the molecular weight of the enzyme was between 29,000 and 26,000 .
acid <unk> of the enzyme contained no <unk> acid or glucosamine or other carbohydrate .
at 25 c , maximum activity was obtained between ph 4.5 and 6.5 .
the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan occurred over a wide range of temperatures and was maximal at 60 c .
the rate of the reaction was inhibited by concentrations of soluble chitosan higher than 0.5 <unk> .
the apparent km calculated from a <unk> plot was <unk> <unk> at ph 5.5 .
the enzyme prevented spore germination and caused a significant decrease in the turbidity of germinated spore suspensions of the mucor strains tested .
such a decrease was the result of a partial lysis of the cell wall .
simple and sensitive procedure for screening yeast mutants that lyse at <unk> temperatures .
after mutagenesis , surviving yeast cells are grown on plates at 25 c and later exposed to 37 c .
the plates are then overlaid with a soft agar containing <unk> at ph 9.7 .
lysed cells liberate alkaline phosphatase which gives rise to a yellow color on and around colonies .
a nucleoside <unk> <unk> from bacillus <unk> .
purification and characterization of the enzyme .
a <unk> , which requires nucleoside triphosphate for reaction , has been purified about <unk> from extracts of bacillus <unk> .
potassium phosphate and ethylene glycol stabilize the purified enzyme .
the enzyme degrades double-stranded dna about 100 times faster than <unk> dna in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate .
double-stranded dna is not degraded to any measurable extent in the absence of atp , but the enzyme exhibits activity toward denatured dna in the absence of nucleoside triphosphate , and this activity seems to be an intrinsic property of this enzyme protein .
the optimum ph is 8.5 and the maximum activity is obtained in the <unk> of <unk> ( 8.0 x 10 ( -3 ) m ) and <unk> ( 7.0 x 10 ( -5 ) m ) .
atp and <unk> are most effective and nucleoside <unk> or <unk> are ineffective .
atp is converted to adp and inorganic phosphate during the reaction and the ratio of the amount of atp cleaved to that of hydrolyzed phosphodiester bonds of dna is about 3:1 .
an inhibitor of the enzyme was observed in bacterial extracts prepared by sonic disruption ; the inhibitory substance is produced in the bacteria in the later stages of cell growth .
preliminary results show that the inhibitor emerged near the void volume of a <unk> <unk> column , and was relatively <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
rapid <unk> for guanosine <unk> monophosphate using <unk> ligand .
a <unk> procedure for guanosine <unk> monophosphate ( cgmp ) is described .
the procedure is based on competitive binding between [ 3h ] cgmp and non-radioactive cgmp , with separation of bound and unbound cgmp by millipore filtration .
the binding reaction showed very high specificity to cgmp , had a broad ph optimum , and reached equilibrium within a short time .
a simple procedure for the <unk> of assay samples using <unk> ag <unk> resin is also described .
cgmp contents in urine samples were assayed without purification .
injection of glucagon into healthy human volunteers resulted in a small but significant reduction in urinary cgmp level , whereas camp excretion increased dramatically .
the effect of tryptophan administration on fatty acid synthesis in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions .
1. tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions : fasted for 24 hr , fasted and <unk> with glucose or <unk> , fasted and administered glycerol intramuscularly , and <unk> .
2. the changes in the contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate <unk> [ ec <unk> ] reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all groups of rats .
the inversely related changes in the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate were associated with the accumulation of <unk> in the livers .
the content of <unk> which exhibited the <unk> effect on the contents of both metabolites was <unk> <unk> per g liver .
3. the rate of incorporation of 3h from <unk> into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats .
the enhancement of the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content .
the <unk> was also related to the decrease of acetyl-coa and the increase of malonyl-coa .
the content of long-chain acyl-coa was not affected .
these effects of tryptophan administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats .
the liver content of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection .
the injection of glycerol into the control and the <unk> rats produced a marked increase of glycerol 3-phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either group .
<unk> it may be concluded that , in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions , the short-term control of fatty acid synthesis by tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation of <unk> a carboxylase [ ec <unk> ] by citrate .
electrophoretic investigations of the acid conformational change of <unk> .
in order to clarify how the electrophoretic behavior reflects the conformational transition of globular proteins , moving boundary electrophoresis was applied to analysis of the acid conformational change of <unk> .
the appearance of only a single electrophoretic boundary in the transition region of the protein suggests a very rapid transition with a half-time estimated to be smaller than 7 min on the basis of the theory of <unk> systems in electrophoresis .
the transition is clearly reflected in the dependence of the mobility on the protein net charge , which shows a sigmoidal curve closely similar to that obtained by a <unk> <unk> plot for the carboxyl groups of <unk> .
it was also concluded from the transition curves that the <unk> does not result in complete unfolding , but that a compact structure is maintained in the acidic region with an apparently expanded form as compared to the native state of the protein .
all results obtained by electrophoresis were also supported by the results of <unk> studies , analytical gel chromatography , and cd measurements .
studies on <unk> of rat liver lysosomes .
ii .
comparative studies on multiple forms of cathepsin a .
the multiple forms of cathepsin a ( ai , aii , and <unk> ) purified from the lysosome fraction of rat liver by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were studied comparatively .
forms ai , aii and <unk> were stable between ph 3.0 and 5.5 , and had ph optima for <unk> at 5.6 , 5.8 , and 5.9 , respectively .
these activities were rapidly lost on heating above 60 degrees .
their isoelectric points were at 4.7 , 4.8 , and 4.9 , and the michaelis constants for <unk> were calculated as 10 , 6.6 , and 4.2 x 10 ( -4 ) m , respectively .
activity was inhibited by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , iodine , and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
<unk> <unk> ( dfp ) , <unk> fluoride ( <unk> ) , <unk> fluoride ( tsf ) , and sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) were inhibitory at a concentration of 10 ( -3 ) m .
soybean trypsin inhibitor , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were not inhibitory , while <unk> caused slight inhibition .
no distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin a despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms ( 100,000 , 200,000 , and 420,000 , respectively ) .
in <unk> analysis , cathepsin ai , aii , and <unk> which had been treated with edta , <unk> , <unk> , and a high concentration of nacl , gave the same <unk> patterns as the untreated enzymes , but treatment with 6 m urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern .
after <unk> ( 50 mm or more ) , the <unk> lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single , identical line .
this suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin a are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related , and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces .
this conclusion is supported by results obtained by <unk> gel electrophoresis in the presence of sds .
recombination of ciliary dynein of tetrahymena with the outer fibers .
recombination of ciliary <unk> of tetrahymena <unk> with the outer fibers was investigated using <unk> , <unk> analysis and electron microscopy .
as reported by gibbons , 30s dynein could recombine with the outer fibers , while 14s dynein did to so a lesser extent .
at acidic ph , however , most of the 14s dynein was also rebound to the outer fibers .
when an excess of crude dynein fraction was added to the outer fiber fraction at ph 8.2 , electron microscopic observations showed that the outer doublet microtubules were decorated not only with arms but also with other <unk> materials .
on the other hand , when crude dynein fraction was mixed with the outer fibers in an appropriate quantity , only arms were reconstituted at the regular positions of <unk> .
atp had an inhibitory effect on the recombination of dynein with the outer fibers .
affinity labeling of d-amino acid oxidase with an <unk> substrate .
the <unk> substrate , <unk> acid ( <unk> ) , was <unk> <unk> by hog kidney d-amino acid oxidase [ ec <unk> ] , with accompanying inactivation of the enzyme .
the flavin which was extracted by hot methanol from the inactivated enzyme was identical with authentic fad by <unk> chromatography and circular dichroism .
the excitation spectrum of emission at 520 nm of the released flavin was very similar to the absorption spectrum of oxidized fad .
the released flavin was reduced by potassium borohydride .
the <unk> prepared after <unk> treatment did not show restored d-amino acid oxidase activity on adding exogenous fad .
the absorption spectrum of this inactivated <unk> showed absorption peaks at 279 and 317 nm , and a shoulder at about 290 nm .
these results strongly indicate that the inactivation reaction is a dynamic affinity labeling with <unk> which produces irreversible inactivation of the enzyme by a covalent modification of an amino acid residue at the active site .
studies on trypsin inhibitor in barley .
i. purification and some properties .
to clarify the properties and functions of a trypsin inhibitor from japanese barley in comparison with the inhibitor from <unk> barley , an inhibitor was isolated from the barley hordeum distichum l <unk> <unk> lamark by extraction with 1 % nacl , ammonium sulfate fractionation and repeated chromatography on <unk> and <unk> .
the final purified preparation of the inhibitor was found to be homogeneous by both chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis .
the inhibitor was <unk> and was stable over the broad ph range from 2 to 11 .
no inhibition was observed by heavy metal ions and many reagents at 10 ( -2 ) m , except that <unk> caused a 69 % loss of activity .
the inhibitor was subjected to isoelectric focusing at ph 7.51 and its molecular weight was calculated to be <unk> by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate .
the apparent dissociation constant for the complex between the inhibitor and trypsin [ ec <unk> ] was 1.64 x 10 ( -7 ) m with casein as a substrate .
one microgram of purified inhibitor inhibited 1.5 mug of pure trypsin in the hydrolysis of <unk> .
by chemical modification of <unk> residues in the inhibitor with <unk> , the inhibitor was shown to be an arginine inhibitor .
the inhibitor contained relatively many basic amino acids and few half <unk> as compared with <unk> barley trypsin inhibitor .
metabolism of dog gastric mucosa .
nucleotide levels in parietal cells .
adenine and pyridine nucleotide levels as well as those of phosphate , <unk> , lactate , pyruvate , <unk> , acetoacetate , glucose , and glycogen were measured in histologically defined parietal and mucous cell sections of biopsies of dog gastric mucosa at rest , and in various secretory states .
as a result of stimulation of secretion , there appeared to be no change in adenine nucleotide levels , or <unk> , but there was a rise in inorganic phosphate and a fall in phosphorylation potential .
however , there was a marked increase in nadh , but no change in nadph with onset of acid secretion .
the increase in the lactate to pyruvate ratio showed that the increased nadh level occurred in the cytoplasm and these data are discussed with reference to change in cell ph .
metal ion dependence of the binding of triiodothyronine by cytosol proteins of bullfrog tadpole tissues .
the binding of triiodothyronine by rana <unk> tadpole tail fin , tail muscle , kidney , and liver cytosol was studied using <unk> charcoal to separate bound and free hormone .
a metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact that edta decreased the binding of triiodothyronine 80 to 90 % in tail fin and tail muscle cytosol .
inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less , 40 to 50 % .
this inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations with an order of potency of <unk> greater than <unk> congruent to <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> .
other <unk> , e.g. <unk> , <unk> , and ethylene glycol bis ( <unk> ) <unk> , <unk> also decreased the binding of triiodothyronine , whereas citrate , oxalate , imidazole , and glycine had no effect .
the triiodothyronine binding capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by edta treatment and dialysis against buffer .
<unk> in the 1 to 10 mm range and <unk> at 1 mm could restore the binding to normal levels .
higher <unk> increased binding 70 % above normal or to <unk> levels .
the triiodothyronine cytosol binding activity was <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , but unaffected by incubation with trypsin , rnase , and dnase , suggesting that the cytosol binding sites are acidic proteins .
scatchard analysis of triiodothyronine binding by the cytosol of different tissues , revealed <unk> of 7.1 x 10 ( 6 ) m ( -1 ) , 11.6 x 10 ( 6 ) m ( -1 ) , 3.6 x 10 ( 6 ) m ( -1 ) , and 68.0 x 10 ( 6 ) m ( -1 ) for tail fin , tail muscle , kidney , and liver cytosol , respectively .
the corresponding maximal binding capacities in <unk> per mg of crude cytosol protein in these four tissues were 10.4 , 0.86 , 1.3 , and 0.04 , respectively .
the active form of cytochrome p-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria .
cytochrome p-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria exists in three forms of molecular weight : 850,000 ( protein 16 ) , of one-half ( protein 8 ) , and of one-quarter of this value ( protein 4 ) .
the forms of the enzyme are named according to the number of subunits and all appear to be active in converting cholesterol to <unk> ( side chain cleavage ) ( <unk> , m. , and hall , p.f. ( 1973 ) j. <unk> <unk> 248 , <unk> ) .
to determine whether all three forms are active at their characteristic molecular weights , the three cytochromes were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 60 min ; the gradients contained all the factors necessary for side chain cleavage including one of the following substrates : cholesterol , <unk> , and <unk> .
regardless of the form of p-450 layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate , enzyme activity ( side chain cleavage ) was observed only in fractions corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of 20 to 22 s which is that for protein 16 .
no activity was observed at s values corresponding to either protein 8 or protein 4 .
these findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome p-450 from adrenocortical mitochondria is that containing 16 subunits , i.e. the form in which the cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria .
forms consisting of eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein 16 become active only by forming protein 16 , at least in an aqueous medium in vitro .
effects of strong electrolyte upon the activity of clostridium perfringens <unk> toward <unk> and <unk> .
clostridium perfringens <unk> was purified by affinity chromatography .
kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with <unk> and with mixed <unk> ( gangliosides ) as substrates .
with the latter substrate in 0.01 m <unk> in the absence of strong electrolyte , the ph optimum for enzymatic activity was 6.8 .
addition of strong electrolyte ( 0.01 to 0.10 m <unk> ) to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the ph optimum , enzymatic activity at ph 5.8 rose approximately <unk> ; a concomitant loss of activity at ph 6.8 was also observed .
the alteration of enzymatic activity caused by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in vmax .
km remained nearly invariant .
thus , a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte concentration .
determination of the pk values of the active functional groups of c. perfringens <unk> revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pka group of the enzyme .
strong electrolyte appeared to shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions between <unk> <unk> micelles and the enzyme molecule , thus protecting the pka group from inactivation .
in comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon enzymatic activity toward the <unk> substrate , those observed with the monovalent substrate , <unk> , were minor .
collectively , these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative substrate specificity of c. perfringens <unk> at a given ph .
furthermore , they explain the low ph optima and skewed ph profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates .
reconstitution of ion transport and respiratory control in vesicles formed from reduced coenzyme <unk> c reductase and phospholipids .
reduced coenzyme <unk> c reductase from bovine heart mitochondria ( complex iii ) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the <unk> dialysis procedure .
soybean phospholipids or mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylethanolamine , and <unk> could be used .
oxidation of reduced coenzyme q2 by the reconstituted vesicles with cytochrome c as oxidant showed the following <unk> phenomena .
1. protons were translocated outward with a coupling ratio , <unk> , of 1.9 <unk> 0.2 .
measurements with mitochondria under similar conditions showed an <unk> ratio of 1.8 .
proton translocation was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net acidification of the medium from the over-all oxidation reaction .
2. potassium ions were taken up by the reconstituted vesicles in the presence of <unk> in a reaction coupled to electron transfer .
the coupling ratio for <unk> uptake , <unk> , was 2.0 in the vesicles and approximately 1.5 in mitochondria .
3. the rate of oxidation of reduced coenzyme q2 by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated up to 10-fold by <unk> or by <unk> plus <unk> and <unk> ions .
addition of <unk> alone in a <unk> medium caused a transient stimulation of electron transfer .
the results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated reduced coenzyme <unk> c reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle .
ion transport and respiratory control in vesicles formed from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme q reductase and phospholipids .
<unk> q reductase from bovine heart mitochondria ( complex i ) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the <unk> dialysis procedure .
mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were required .
oxidation of nadh by coenzyme q1 catalyzed by the reconstituted vesicles was coupled to proton translocation , directed inward , with an <unk> ratio greater than 1.4 .
similar experiments measuring proton translocation in <unk> particles gave an <unk> ratio of 1.8 .
the proton translocation in both systems was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net proton uptake from the reduction of coenzyme q1 by nadh .
electron transfer in the reconstituted vesicles also caused the uptake of the <unk> anion <unk> .
the rate of electron transfer by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated about 3-fold by <unk> or by <unk> plus <unk> and <unk> ions .
the results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated <unk> q reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle .
<unk> acyltransferase activity in particulate preparations from anaerobic , <unk> cells of <unk> <unk> .
involvement of acyl <unk> derivatives of acyl carrier protein in the synthesis of complex lipids .
crude particulate preparations obtained from anaerobic , <unk> cells of <unk> <unk> have been shown to possess a significant level of <unk> acyltransferase ( ec <unk> ) activity .
in contrast to the enzyme from escherichia coli , the r. <unk> <unk> acyltransferase has a high specificity for acyl <unk> derivatives of acyl carrier protein ( acp ) as acyl donors for the reaction .
only limited , nonlinear <unk> incorporation into lipid occurs when acyl coenzyme a ( coa ) derivatives are employed as acyl substrate .
with <unk> as substrate , maximal enzyme activity was observed at 40 degrees , over a broad ph range ( 6.0 to 8.5 ) and did not require a divalent metal cation .
the presence of <unk> stimulated <unk> 15 to 20 % .
when <unk> or <unk> was employed as sole acyl group donor , the major products recoverable from the reaction mixtures were <unk> acid , <unk> acid , and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> gave comparable maximal velocities in the initial acylation of <unk> , the formation of <unk> acid occurred preferentially with the unsaturated <unk> derivative .
studies on thyroid <unk> proteins .
i. the subunit structure of human <unk> globulin and its interaction with ligands .
<unk> globulin was isolated from human plasma by ammonium sulfate fractionation , chromatographic separations on <unk> , gel chromatography , and two different electrophoretic procedures .
the highly purified was homogeneous when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , <unk> analyses , and <unk> determinations .
the weight average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium <unk> was 54,000 and by sedimentation diffusion data 55,000 .
amino acid analyses indicated a minimum of 110 amino acid residues per molecule .
by determination of the minimum in the curve for the fraction of maximum deviation from the amino acid analyses it was found that the minimum molecular weight for the polypeptide was 12,200 .
carbohydrate analyses demonstrated the presence f <unk> amounts of <unk> , galactose , and glucosamine , and the carbohydrate portion constituted 7.5 % of the total weight .
the amino acid analyses suggested that <unk> globulin is composed of 4 subunits .
molecular weight determinations by gel chromatography in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride indicated the presence of three species of globulin with apparent molecular weights 52,000 , 25,000 , and 13,500 , respectively .
prolonged storage in guanidine hydrochloride promoted a more than 60 % yield of the monomeric species .
moreover , a <unk> of <unk> globulin was isolated and shown to consist of two polypeptide chains of similar molecular weight ...
structural studies of two <unk> <unk> in relation to the <unk> specificity .
<unk> of the two <unk> <unk> , ( man ) 5 ( glcnac ) <unk> and ( man ) 6 ( glcnac ) <unk> , were revealed by borate paper electrophoresis of oligosaccharide alcohols obtained from the <unk> by <unk> h digestion and <unk> reduction .
the structures of the major components of the oligosaccharides were determined by the combination of methylation analysis , <unk> , and <unk> digestion .
based on the results , the whole structures of the major components of ( man ) 5 ( glcnac ) <unk> and ( man ) 6 ( glcnac ) <unk> were elucidated as <unk> leads to 6 [ <unk> leads to 3 ] <unk> leads to 6 [ <unk> leads to 3 [ <unk> leads to <unk> leads to <unk> leads to asn and <unk> leads to 6 [ <unk> leads to 3 ] <unk> leads to 6 [ <unk> leads to <unk> leads to 3 ] <unk> leads to <unk> leads to glcnac leads to asn , respectively .
since <unk> <unk> d hydrolyzes ( man ) 5 ( glcnac ) <unk> but not ( man ) 6 ( glcnac ) <unk> , the presence of the unsubstituted <unk> residue linked at the c-3 position of the terminal mannose of <unk> leads to <unk> leads to 4 <unk> core must be essential for the action of the enzyme .
use of <unk> to study hydrogen transfer in the d-amino acid oxidase reaction .
the <unk> of hog kidney d-amino acid oxidase was reconstituted with <unk> adenine dinucleotide ( <unk> ) to yield a protein which contains 1.5 mol of <unk> of enzyme .
the <unk> enzyme forms complexes with benzoate , <unk> benzoate , and <unk> which are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed with native enzyme .
the complex with <unk> exhibits a new long wavelength absorption band characteristic of a flavin charge-transfer complex .
the reconstituted enzyme exhibits no activity when assayed by d-alanine oxidation .
however , the bound chromophore can be reduced by alanine , phenylalanine , proline , methionine , and valine , but not by glutamate or aspartate , indicating the <unk> enzyme retains the substrate specificity of the native enzyme .
reduction of the enzyme by d-alanine exhibits a <unk> deuterium isotope effect .
<unk> of the reduced enzyme occurred in the presence of pyruvate plus ammonia , but not with pyruvate alone or ammonia alone .
<unk> and <unk> , but not <unk> could replace pyruvate .
reduced enzyme isolated following reaction with [ <unk> ] alanine was found to contain 0.5 mol of <unk> of <unk> .
after denaturation of the <unk> enzyme , the radioactivity was identified as <unk> .
reaction of the reduced <unk> enzyme with pyruvate plus ammonia prior to denaturation yields [ <unk> ] alanine and unlabeled <unk> .
these results suggest that reduction and <unk> of <unk> <unk> involves the <unk> transfer of <unk> from substrate to <unk> .
the <unk> receptor in liver plasma membranes .
characterization and comparison with the insulin receptor .
<unk> ( <unk> insulin-like activity , soluble in acid ethanol ) is a serum peptide that has insulin-like and <unk> activities .
we have demonstrated previously that liver plasma membranes possess separate receptors for <unk> and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail .
in the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the <unk> receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same tissue .
both <unk> and <unk> bind rapidly and reversibly to their receptors in liver membranes ; maximal <unk> binding occurs at 20 degrees while maximal insulin binding is seen at 1-4 degrees .
the ph optimum for <unk> binding is broad ( 6.0 to 8.0 ) , in contrast to the very sharp ph optimum ( 7.5 to 8.0 ) for insulin binding .
both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity .
with the insulin receptor , <unk> and insulin analogues compete for binding in proportion to their insulin-like potency : insulin greater than <unk> greater than <unk> .
with the <unk> receptor , <unk> is most potent and the order is reversed : <unk> greater than <unk> greater than insulin .
furthermore , six preparations of <unk> which varied <unk> in biological activity competed for <unk> binding in order of their potencies .
<unk> which had been inactivated biologically by reduction and <unk> and growth hormone were less than <unk> as potent as the most purified <unk> preparation .
purified preparations of fibroblast growth factor , epidermal growth factor , nerve growth factor , and <unk> b and c were less than 1 % as effective as <unk> in competing for the <unk> suggesting that these factors act through other receptors .
in contrast , <unk> a was 10 % as active as <unk> and <unk> activity was fully as active as <unk> in competing for the <unk> receptor .
analysis of the data suggests that there are approximately 50 times more insulin receptors than <unk> receptors per liver cell , while the apparent affinity of <unk> receptors is somewhat higher than that of the insulin receptor .
decarboxylation of <unk> to pyruvate by purified avian liver phosphoenolpyruvate <unk> .
phosphoenolpyruvate <unk> , which has been isolated from chicken liver mitochondria in essentially homogenous form , carries out the irreversible decarboxylation of <unk> to pyruvate in the presence of catalytic amounts of gdp or idp , as well as the reversible decarboxylation of <unk> to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of substrate amounts of gtp or itp .
the <unk> and <unk> reactions are similar in their nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein .
however , the two activities vary markedly in their response to added metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents .
phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion , with <unk> the most effective species .
this reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as <unk> .
in contrast , the <unk> reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal ions , including <unk> , and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents .
these observations and the demonstration that pyruvate <unk> activity is very low or absent make it unlikely that pyruvate formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate .
although the <unk> reaction is inhibited by added metal ions , the reaction is also inhibited by <unk> agents such as <unk> and <unk> , suggesting that the reaction is dependent on the presence of a metal ion .
it has not been possible , however , to demonstrate that the enzyme is a <unk> .
hemoglobin deer lodge ( beta 2 his replaced by arg ) .
consequences of altering the <unk> binding site .
hemoglobin deer lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta 2 position .
x-ray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site for <unk> .
the substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding .
when stripped of anions , hb deer lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to hb a .
the alkaline bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below ph 6 and above ph 8 .
in the presence of <unk> the cooperativity in increases to <unk> and the ph dependence of oxygen binding is reduced .
this contrasts with the enhanced bohr effect seen for hb a in the presence of organic phosphates .
due to enhanced anion binding at high ph , hb deer lodge has a slightly lower oxygen affinity than hb a at ph 9 in the presence of <unk> or inositol <unk> .
kinetic studies at neutral ph in the absence of organic phosphates revealed <unk> in the rate of oxygen dissociation from hb deer lodge , while approximately linear time courses were observed for hb a .
the fast phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great ph sensitivity , and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the slow phase .
the two phases are not resolvable at high ph .
co combination kinetics are much like those of hb a except that `` fast '' and `` slow '' phases were apparent at wavelengths near the <unk> <unk> point .
we suggest that functional differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in hb deer lodge .
after flash photolysis of the co derivative , the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for hb deer lodge than for hb a .
this may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits .
the substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered , the primary differences being expressed at high ph where hb deer lodge binds anions more strongly than hb a .
the properties of hb deer lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of <unk> .
patterns of fatty acid release from endogenous substrates by human platelet <unk> and membranes .
we describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet <unk> and membranes .
the method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are <unk> and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that , at the time of lipid extraction , can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids .
we found four types of <unk> activities in human platelets .
in <unk> at ph 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides .
however , enough arachidonic acid was released at this ph level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown , since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid .
with membranous preparations , in the alkaline ph range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids .
at ph 8.5 , where release of the saturated acids , palmitic and stearic , predominated , their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid .
at ph 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values ; however , the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids .
linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid , despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the <unk> of phospholipids .
pertinently , the choline phospholipids are <unk> and the <unk> phospholipids <unk> , while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid .
with this in mind , we raise the possibility that the phospholipase a2 of human platelets is an <unk> because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane .
oxidation of nadph by <unk> particles from beef heart in complete absence of transhydrogenase activity from nadph to nad .
treatment of <unk> particles ( etp ) with trypsin at 0 degrees destroyed nadph leads to nad ( or <unk> adenine dinucleotide , <unk> ) transhydrogenase activity .
nadh oxidase activity was unaffected ; nadph oxidase and nadh leads to <unk> transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than 10 % .
when etp was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees , nadph leads to nad transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost , nadph oxidase activity was slowly destroyed , but nadh oxidase activity remained intact .
the reduction pattern by nadph , nadph + nad , and nadh of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm ( flavin and iron-sulfur centers ) in complex i ( <unk> reductase ) or etp treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of transhydrogenase activity .
the sensitivity of the nadph leads to nad transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible <unk> residues in the enzyme .
<unk> residues are considered to be positively charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes .
treatment of etp with the specific <unk> reagent , <unk> , inhibited <unk> from nadph leads to nad ( or <unk> ) .
it had no effect on nadh oxidation , and inhibited nadph oxidation and nadh leads to <unk> <unk> by only 10 to 15 % even after 30 to 60 min incubation of etp with <unk> .
the inhibition of nadph leads to nad <unk> was diminished considerably when <unk> was added to etp in the presence of nad or nadp .
when both nad and nadp were present , the <unk> effect was completely abolished , thus suggesting the possible presence of <unk> residues at the nucleotide binding site of the nadph leads to nad transhydrogenase enzyme .
under conditions that <unk> from nadph to nad was completely inhibited by trypsin or <unk> , nadph oxidation rate was larger than or equal to 220 <unk> <unk> <unk> etp protein at ph 6.0 and 30 degrees .
the above results establish that in the respiratory chain of <unk> mitochondria nadh oxidation , nadph oxidation , and nadph leads to nad <unk> are independent reactions .
protein inhibitor of acid <unk> .
improved purification procedure and properties .
a method is described for the extensive purification of acid <unk> ( acid dnase ) and its specific inhibitor from beef liver , the existence of which had been only supported by indirect evidence .
by the use of <unk> acid <unk> , eight other proteins interacting with the enzyme have been detected .
one of them ( molecular weight , 59,000 ) was identified as responsible for phosphodiesterase activity which is often a contaminant of dnase preparations .
acid dnase ( free of phosphodiesterase ) and its inhibitor have been obtained as homogeneous proteins , as determined by sodium dodecyl <unk> gel electrophoresis .
the molecular weight of acid dnase and its inhibitor are , respectively , 26,500 and 21,500 ; those of other proteins range from 17,000 to 112,000 .
the properties of beef liver acid dnase are similar to those described for the enzymes extracted from other sources .
the same alteration of dnase kinetics by this inhibitor , as that previously demonstrated with an impure protein has been confirmed ; the sigmoidal shape observed at ph 5 for the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration progressively disappears with increasing ph .
we have also demonstrated that rna , which inhibits the acid dnase through a competitive binding to the catalytic site , is able , like the substrate , to reverse the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme .
<unk> enzymes in chlamydomonas flagella .
nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella .
atp , originating in the cells , is utilized for motility by <unk> protein ( s ) called dynein , and the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin , and probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides , are prerequisites for the assembly of microtubules .
besides dynein , which can be <unk> from chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous , <unk> or <unk> atpase , we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations .
a homogeneous , low molecular weight , <unk> adenosine <unk> was isolated , which was inhibited by <unk> and was not specific for atp .
this enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases .
it was absent from extracts of tetrahymena cilia .
its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer , or in steering or tactic responses .
two species of adenylate kinase were isolated , one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella ; the latter was also present in cell bodies .
a large part of flagellar nucleoside <unk> activity could not be <unk> .
two soluble enzyme species were identified , one of which was also present in cell bodies .
since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly , we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside <unk> <unk> with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization .
arginine kinase was not detected in chlamydomonas flagellar extracts .
in vitro biosynthesis of <unk> ( g7 ) by mouse brain <unk> .
a <unk> activity which catalyzes the synthesis of <unk> ( g7 ) from added <unk> and <unk> acid has been demonstrated in mouse brain <unk> .
the enzyme reaction shows a ph optimum of 6.3 and requires detergents .
both <unk> and <unk> inhibited the reaction , whereas <unk> had no effect .
the apparent km for <unk> leading to g7 was estimated to be 8.7 x 10 ( -4 ) m .
the same microsomal preparation also synthesized <unk> when ceramide <unk> was the glycolipid acceptor .
the apparent km for ceramide <unk> was about one-tenth that for <unk> .
when the preparations were partially inactivated by heat the synthesis of g7 and of <unk> was reduced at approximately the same rate .
liver appeared to have the highest activity for g7 synthesis ( as well as of <unk> ) , followed by brain .
the synthesis of b7 by mouse brain <unk> in vitro demonstrates a new pathway for brain ganglioside synthesis .
proteolytic enzymes of the k-1 strain of streptomyces griseus obtained from a commercial preparation ( <unk> ) .
purification and characterization of the carboxypeptidase .
we described earlier the facilitated purifications of the trypsin and aminopeptidase components present in <unk> ( <unk> , k. d. , chow , k. <unk> , and awad , w. m. , jr. ( 1973 ) j. <unk> <unk> 248 , <unk> ) .
a partially resolved protein mixture left over after one of the steps in that procedure was passed through a <unk> <unk> column .
by this means , a component with carboxypeptidase activity was separated from associated serine <unk> .
further purification of this <unk> to apparent homogeneity was acheived by <unk> through the same <unk> column and by <unk> chromatography .
a single protein band was observed after acrylamide gel electrophoresis ; analysis by sedimentation equilibrium using the meniscus depletion method gave a molecular weight of 30,300 .
this enzyme demonstrates activity against <unk> and <unk> , <unk> ; no activity was found against <unk> ethyl ester , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> .
the maximum activity lies between ph values of 7 and 8 ; the enzyme is stable between ph values of 6 and 10 .
at room temperature <unk> inactivates the enzyme completely whereas edta has no effect .
of the many cations tested , only <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> restores activity to the <unk> enzyme ; <unk> provided 3 times the native activity .
the metal in the native protein was found to be zinc .
these findings are similar to those recorded with bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase a , and suggest the possibility that the present enzyme may ge genetically related to the mammalian protein , as in previously noted examples of homology of three <unk> <unk> to pancreatic serine enzymes .
<unk> photosynthetic activities in chloroplast membranes from chlamydomonas <unk> , y-1 .
location of electron transport chain components in chloroplast membranes of chlamydomonas <unk> , y-1 was investigated by use of proteolytic digestion with soluble or <unk> trypsin .
digestion of intact membrane vesicles with soluble trypsin inactivates the <unk> system , the <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> inhibition site of photosystem ii , the electron transport between the two <unk> as well as the ferredoxin nadp reductase .
reduction of nadp with artificial electron donors for photosystem i could be restored , however , by addition of purified reductase to <unk> membranes .
electron transfer activities of <unk> i and ii reaction centers were resistant to trypsin digestion either from outside or from within the thylakoids when active trypsin was trapped inside the membrane vesicles by sonication and digestion carried out in the presence of trypsin inhibitor added from outside .
in the latter case , the <unk> system was also found to be resistant to digestion .
<unk> <unk> trypsin inactivated only the ferredoxin nadp reductase .
photosynthetically active membranes obtained at different stages of development showed a basically similar behavior toward trypsin .
a complex of cardiac cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c .
the interactions of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac mitochondria were investigated .
cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c formed a 1:1 molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength .
the complex was stable to <unk> <unk> chromatography .
the formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned .
the complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or ph exceeding 10 and only partially dissociated in 8 m urea .
no complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on 64 % of its lysine residues or <unk> on its 2 methionine residues .
complexes with molecular ratios of less than 1:1 ( i.e. more cytochrome c ) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c , or cytochrome c with all lysine residues <unk> , or a `` 1-65 heme peptide '' from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used .
these results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes .
the reduced complex was <unk> with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 x 10 ( -5 ) and 5 x <unk> ( -5 ) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide .
the complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32 % and 40 % respectively , of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone .
the complex was less <unk> than cytochrome c1 alone .
the complex exhibited remarkably different circular dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c .
we concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices .
all results available would indicate that in the complex cytochrome c1 was bound at the entrance to the heme crevice of cytochrome c on the <unk> side of the heme crevice .
leucine aminopeptidase ( bovine lens ) .
effect of ph on the relative binding of <unk> and <unk> to and on activation of the enzyme .
incubation of leucine aminopeptidase ( bovine lens ) ( ec <unk> ) with various concentrations of <unk> at various ph values in 1 m kcl and <unk> m <unk> at 37 degrees confirms that <unk> competes with <unk> for binding only 1 site per <unk> subunit .
the ratio of the apparent association constants ( <unk> = <unk> ) at this site ( site 1 ) was estimated to be <unk> at ph 8.16 , <unk> at ph 8.44 , 3,590 at ph 8.78 , and 660 at ph 9.14 .
the decrease in values of <unk> with increasing ph in the activation of leucine aminopeptidase by <unk> is attributed to the lowering of the free <unk> concentration relative to that of free <unk> caused by the formation of <unk> and zn ( oh ) 2 complexes with increasing <unk> concentration .
when corrections are made for the binding of <unk> by <unk> ions , the <unk> ratio of association constants ( <unk> = <unk> ) for the relative binding of <unk> and <unk> at site 1 of leucine aminopeptidase in 29,800 .
from the effect of ph on the relative binding constant , a value ( <unk> ) for the product of the two stepwise association constants for the formation of zn ( oh ) 2 from <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> + <unk> in equilibrium <unk> ; <unk> + <unk> in equilibrium zn ( oh ) 2 ) was estimated to be 4.42 x 10 ( 10 ) m-2 at 37 degrees .
values of km at ph 7.5 and 30 degrees with <unk> <unk> as substrate in the presence of 0.01 m <unk> are 4.13 and 2.01 mm for the <unk> and <unk> enzymes , respectively .
values for vmax are 0.2 and 2.49 <unk> , respectively .
biochemical studies of <unk> sensation .
binding of <unk> [ 3h ] alanine to a <unk> fraction from catfish barbel epithelium .
large numbers of taste buds are distributed over the body surface of the channel catfish <unk> punctatus , with the barbels having an especially high density .
l-alanine , as well as certain other amino acids , are taste stimuli in this animal .
epithelial tissue obtained by gentle scraping of the barbel surface was fractionated by differential centrifugation .
a <unk> fraction ( p2 ) was prepared that was enriched in l [ oh ] alanine binding activity , the plasma membrane marker enzyme <unk> , and the mitochondrial marker succinate cytochrome c reductase , but not the microsomal marker nadh cytochrome c <unk> .
<unk> .
binding of <unk> [ oh ] alanine was measured using a millipore filter method in which correction for non-specific binding was also determined .
time , temperature , and ph for measuring binding activity were established .
at the optimal ph of 7.8 , the kd for l-alanine is 4.8 x 10 ( -6 ) m .
the first order dissociation rate constant at 6 degrees is 3.8 x 10 ( -4 ) s-1 and at 24 degrees it is 12.1 x 10 ( -4 ) s-1 .
the second order rate constant for association is between 10 ( 2 ) and 10 ( 3 ) m-1 s-1 .
reversibility of the binding interaction was also demonstrates by the rapid displacement of bound <unk> [ 3h ] alanine by a large excess of unlabeled l-alanine .
that the binding does not represent incorporation into protein was confirmed by the lack of effect of <unk> .
the amounts bound of several other <unk> amino acids <unk> determined .
<unk> of the coronary veins in diffuse coronary arteriosclerosis .
since the coronary veins and capillaries are not involved with <unk> disease the authors performed experimental , and afterwards , clinical total and selective coronary vein <unk> .
acute myocardial ischaemia created for instance by ligation of the anterior descending branch , was treated by an internal mammary artery to regional coronary vein anastomosis .
in 21 patients the selective <unk> of the `` vena cordis magna '' or of `` vena cordis media '' , and total <unk> of the coronary sinus was performed .
the clinical improvement and follow-up studies seem to be promising in the treatment of patients with advanced diffuse heavy coronary arteriosclerosis .
in acute myocardial ischaemia with <unk> localized coronary occlusion , the aim of regional vein <unk> is to minimize the area of infarction .
preparations of internal mammary arteries for coronary bypass with <unk> papaverine .
structure , composition , physical properties , and turnover of proliferated peroxisomes .
a study of the trophic effects of <unk> on rat liver .
peroxisome proliferation has been induced with <unk> ( <unk> [ <unk> ] <unk> ) <unk> acid ( <unk> ) .
dna , protein , cytochrome oxidase , <unk> , and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant .
peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165 % , 50 % , 30 % , and 0 % of the controls for catalase , urate oxidase , <unk> acid oxidase , and d-amino acid oxidase , respectively .
for catalase the change results from a decrease in <unk> activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity .
the average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 <unk> 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 <unk> 0.25 mum after treatment .
therefore , the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles .
after tissue fractionation , approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation , but no change in size .
in <unk> submitted to mechanical stress , proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility ; unexpectedly , <unk> stabilizes lysosomes .
our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins .
the changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after <unk> allow the calculation of their half-lives .
these are the same as those found for total catalase , in normal and treated rats , after allyl isopropyl <unk> : about 1.3 days , a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy .
a sequential increase in liver rna concentration , [ 14c ] leucine incorporation into <unk> proteins and into <unk> catalase , and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver , characterize the trophic effect of the drug used .
in males , <unk> is more active than cpib , another peroxisome <unk> drug ; in females , only <unk> is active .
localization of nadh oxidase on the surface of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes by a new <unk> method .
the ultrastructural localization of nadh oxidase , a possible enzyme in the increased oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( pmn ) during phagocytosis , was studied .
a new <unk> technique for the localization of h2o2 , a product of nadh oxidase activity , was developed .
<unk> ions , in the presence of peroxide , form an <unk> precipitate .
resting and <unk> stimulated pmn were exposed to <unk> ions at ph 7.5 to demonstrate sites of <unk> , <unk> h2o2 production .
resting pmn <unk> slight activity on the plasma membrane ; <unk> pmn had extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the <unk> and on the plasma membrane .
peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of catalase on cerium precipitation ; the surface localization of the enzyme responsible was confirmed by using <unk> inhibitors of enzymatic activity .
a correlative study was performed with an <unk> , <unk> system .
as with cerium , <unk> deposition on the surface of the cell was nadh dependent , cyanide insensitive , and stimulated by phagocytosis .
superoxide dismutase did not inhibit <unk> reduction , as observed <unk> , indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without superoxide interposition .
these findings , combined with oxygen consumption studies on resting and stimulated pmn in the presence or absence of nadh , indicate that nadh oxidase is a surface enzyme in human pmn .
it is internalized during phagocytosis and retains its <unk> capacity within the phagocytic vacuole .
defective lysosomal enzyme secretion in kidneys of <unk> ( beige ) mice .
the beige mouse is an animal model for the human <unk> syndrome , a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types .
in mice , treatment with androgenic hormones causes a <unk> elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme , <unk> .
beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney <unk> , beta-galactosidase , and <unk> ( <unk> ) levels than normal mice .
other <unk> enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol , mitochondria , and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice .
no significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment , nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen .
<unk> staining for <unk> together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher <unk> content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant <unk> lysosomes in tubule cells near the <unk> boundary .
in normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine .
levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice .
it appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper fusion with the plasma membrane .
a similar defect could account for characteristics of the <unk> syndrome .
stimulation of <unk> transport in control and <unk> cells by ethidium bromide .
recently we demonstrated that ethidium bromide altered the plasma and subcellular membrane glycoproteins in control and virus transformed cells .
it is reported here that ethidium bromide also stimulated the membrane associated process of sugar transport .
the km of the virus transformed cells and the ethidium bromide treated cells is the same as that of the control cells while the maximum velocity as compared to the control cells is significantly increased .
the transport of <unk> was inhibited by glucose , cytochalasin b and neuraminidase but was unaffected by variations in cell density or ph of the incubation medium .
effect of pharmacological agents on human keratinocyte mitosis in vitro .
ii .
inhibition by catecholamines .
catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human keratinocytes probably via a block in the g2 part of the cell cycle .
epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition ( 49 % ) at a concentration as low as 4.5 x 10 ( -10 ) m , while its analog , <unk> , produced 47 % inhibition at 1 x 10 ( -10 ) m .
norepinephrine elicited a 49 % inhibitory response at 1 x 10 ( -8 ) m .
one other catecholamine , dopamine , caused a 53 % decrease in mitosis at 1 x 10 ( -6 ) m .
other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine , 58 % at 1 x 10 ( -7 ) m ; octopamine , 47 % at 1 x 10 ( -5 ) m ; and tyramine , 52 % at 1 x 10 ( -4 ) m .
serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 x 10 ( -4 ) m .
various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system .
the alpha blocking agent , <unk> , had no effect on mitosis .
when added in <unk> with epinephrine or norepinephrine , no reduction of the <unk> mitotic inhibition was observed .
the beta blocking agent , propranolol , by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 x 10 ( -6 ) m .
when added along with epinephrine or <unk> , propranolol reduced the <unk> mitotic inhibition approximately 65 % .
in addition , propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine , an alpha adrenergic agent .
however , another beta blocking agent , <unk> , showed strong mitotic inhibition ( 53 % ) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 x 10 ( -8 ) m .
the effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol .
these data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the <unk> mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro , the nature of the <unk> interaction may be complex .
<unk> growth of htc cells containing <unk> and <unk> tyrosine aminotransferase and cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors .
htc cells have been made to grow in chemically defined medium without any macromolecular supplements whatsoever .
initial estimates of their relative amino acid requirements have been made .
the cells grown in the defined medium retain many of the differentiated features which have been the focus of investigation in their <unk> counterparts .
thus , the cells in defined medium contain cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and have tyrosine aminotransferase which can be induced by glucocorticoids , serum or insulin .
these cells also produce , in small amounts , an as yet undefined rat serum protein .
stimulation of lactic acid production in chick embryo fibroblasts by serum and high ph in the absence of external glucose .
lactic acid production by chick embryo fibroblasts occurs in the absence of exogenous glucose .
fifteen to 50-fold less lactic acid is formed in the absence of glucose than in its presence .
nevertheless , serum and ph stimulation enhances this residual lactic acid production to the same relative extent as when glucose is present .
the amount of lactic acid formed can not be accounted for by the catabolism of residual glucose in the medium since its concentration is less than one-tenth that of the lactic acid eventually produced .
moreover , the residual glucose concentration remains constant or increases during the course of the experiment .
to a large extent lactic acid accumulation in the absence of external glucose is dependent on the presence of amino acids in the medium , but amino acid transport is not affected by the stimulatory agents used in this study .
the results suggest that treatments which stimulate cell multiplication also activate those enzymatic pathways which convert amino acids to pyruvic and thence to lactic acid .
isolation and studies of the granules of the <unk> of limulus polyphemus , the horseshoe crab .
granules were isolated from the cytoplasm of the <unk> of limulus polyphemus , the horseshoe crab , by disruption of cells obtained from blood which had been drawn into 2 mm propranolol .
the granules subsequently were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient that contained heparin .
extracts of the granules were prepared by freezing and thawing the granule preparations in distilled water .
transmission and scanning electron microscopy of the granules revealed round or ovoid particles .
however , only one type of granule appeared to be present .
the ultraviolet spectrum of the extract of <unk> granules demonstrated a peak at 277 nm at ph 7.4 , and a shift into two peaks of 281 nm and 290 nm at alkaline ph .
analytical <unk> revealed a pattern similar to that observed with <unk> prepared from intact <unk> .
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , in the presence of urea at ph 4.5 , demonstrated patterns similar to those observed with <unk> lysate .
extracts of the granules were gelled by bacterial endotoxin .
the blood of the horseshoe crab contains only one type of cell , the <unk> .
previous studies have shown that the blood coagulation mechanism of limulus is contained entirely within <unk> .
the current studies suggest that the granules , which pack the cytoplasm of these cells , contain all of the factors required for the coagulation of blood , including the <unk> protein .
the intracellularly localized coagulation system is released from <unk> when their granules rupture during cell aggregation .

purification of human red cell glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by affinity chromatography .
human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with nadph was efficiently bound with <unk> nadp , whereas the enzyme associated with nadp was poorly bound with <unk> nadp .
after the elimination of haemoglobin from <unk> by treatment with <unk> , the enzyme was converted into the <unk> form and was applied on an affinity column .
the enzyme was specifically eluted from the column by nadp in the elution buffer .
a homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained in high yield .
simultaneous determination of propranolol and <unk> in plasma by mass <unk> .
a quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of propranolol and its active metabolite <unk> in human plasma is described .
plasma samples are extracted at ph 9.6 with ethyl acetate after the addition of sodium <unk> and the internal standard <unk> .
the extracts are <unk> with trifluoroacetic anhydride before separation on a gas chromatograph -- mass spectrometer .
detection and quantitation of the <unk> derivatives are made by <unk> monitoring .
the minimum detectable concentration of propranolol is 1 ng/ml and of <unk> 5 ng/ml using <unk> plasma samples .
no interferences from normal plasma constituents or from drugs commonly prescribed together with propranolol were detected .
high pressure liquid chromatography on cannabis .

amino acid analysis by ion-exchange chromatography using a lithium elution gradient .
influence of methanol concentration and sample ph .
the separation of amino acids has been achieved on a short column of <unk> c2 resin , with a lithium <unk> system .
the analysis took 8 h .
the separation of asparagine and glutamine from glutamic acid was highly dependent on the sample ph and on the methanol concentration in the first buffer of the gradient .
the method has been applied to analysis of human plasma and granulocytes for amino acids .
determination of <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> <unk> in human plasma , urine and faeces .
a gas chromatographic method is described for assay of <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> <unk> ( bw <unk> ) in human plasma , urine and faeces .
after extraction into 1,2-dichloroethane from alkaline medium the compound is converted to the <unk> derivative which is injected into a gas chromatograph and measured using a <unk> electron capture detector .
the assay produces a linear calibration curve over the range 0-30 <unk> when the internal standard method is used .
reproducibility is good and sensitivity down to 1 ng injected on column is possible .
the method has been used to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of bw <unk> in man and has been semi-automated by the use of an <unk> and dedicated computer .
methods to improve detection of pneumococci in respiratory secretions .
simple methods to enhance the detection of pneumococci in respiratory secretions are needed .
sheep blood agar containing 5 mug of gentamicin per ml was more often positive ( 89 % ) than either standard sheep blood agar ( 54 % ) or mouse inoculation ( 65 % ) in recovering pneumococci from 62 adult and pediatric patients .
in adults , the direct <unk> test on sputum smear was a rapid , sensitive method for predicting subsequent pneumococcal isolation by culture ( 19 of 20 patients , 95 % ) .
the <unk> test and gentamicin plate show improved sensitivity over current techniques for pneumococcal detection and can be recommended for general use .
dependence on dose of the acute effects of ethanol on liver metabolism in vivo .
the dose dependence of the acute effects of ethanol upon liver intermediary metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in rats .
ethanol was given i.p. in doses of 0.69 , 1.7 , and 3.0 g/kg in equal volumes ( 20 <unk> ) .
the liver was <unk> 120 min after injection , and multiple metabolites were measured in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue .
each group showed a significantly different pattern of metabolites , redox states , and phosphorylation potentials although the rate of ethanol disappearance , at least between the two highest dose groups , was not significantly different .
the mitochondrial free [ <unk> ] / [ nadh ] ratios and the cytoplasmic free [ <unk> ] / [ nadph ] ratio were paradoxically most reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized with increasing dose .
once established , the differences in these ratios between the groups tended to persist with time , relatively independent of the concentration of ethanol .
in a somewhat different pattern , the phosphorylation potential ( [ atp ] / [ adp ] [ p1 ] ) remained at the control level in the low-dose group but was significantly elevated in the two <unk> groups .
the results , therefore , show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that can not be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to nadh production .
factors affecting the solubility of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals .
the solubility of triclinic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate ( <unk> ) crystals was measured under varying conditions using <unk> crystals , expressing solubility as <unk> per liter of <unk> in solution .
in a <unk> <unk> buffer ph 7.4 , the solubility of accurately sized <unk> crystals ( <unk> ) was <unk> with maximal solubility being attained after about 8 h incubation at <unk> .
reduction in crystal size , decrease in ph , increase in ionic strength , <unk> , citrate , and albumin all increased solubility .
the most marked effects on solubility occurred when changing the calcium concentration or by enzymatic hydrolysis of <unk> pyrophosphate to orthophosphate .
it was found that decreasing the ionized calcium level below 5 <unk> ml resulted in a progressive enhancement of solubility .
the observed <unk> effects of albumin could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby , altered ionized calcium level .
<unk> calcium in synovial fluid was only 40 % of the total calcium concentration , which means most joint fluids are normally near the critical concentration of 5 <unk> ml of ionized calcium , below which solubility is enhanced .
during surgery , especially <unk> , calcium levels fall , favoring dissolution of <unk> crystals .
we speculate that the slight decrease in crystal size during dissolution frees them from their cartilaginous mold , resulting in a dose-dependent inflammatory reaction as they are `` shed '' into the joint space .
crystal shedding may be reinforced by the modest fall in joint fluid ph accompanying the inflammatory response .
lorazepam compared with pentobarbital for nighttime sedation .
lorazepam ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 4 mg ) was compared with pentobarbital ( 60 and 180 mg ) for its effect on sleep in `` hospital insomnia . ''
<unk> data were collected by research nurses .
lorazepam was found to be a potent nighttime sedative : 1 to 1.25 mg of lorazepam is equivalent to 100 mg sodium pentobarbital for measures of sleep quality and duration .
at this dose level it is less effective than 100 mg of pentobarbital as a sleep inducer .
studies at higher doses ( up to 4 mg ) indicate that lorazepam has a wide therapeutic index .
evidence from rats that morphine tolerance is a learned response .
it is proposed that the direct analgesic effect of morphine becomes attenuated over the course of successive administrations of the narcotic by a conditioned , compensatory , <unk> response elicited by the administration procedure , the net result being analgesic tolerance .
using the `` hot plate '' analgesia assessment situation with rats , this conditioning view of tolerance is supported by several findings : ( a ) it is necessary to have reliable environmental cues predicting the systemic effects of morphine if tolerance is to be observed , ( b ) a <unk> conditioned response may be observed in <unk> subjects when drug administration cues are followed by a placebo , and ( c ) merely by repeatedly presenting environmental cues previously associated with morphine ( but now presented with a placebo ) , morphine tolerance can be extinguished .
<unk> for determination of free and <unk> calcium in model systems .
the determination with <unk> of free and <unk> calcium in model systems of known composition , ionic strength , and ph was investigated .
the spectra of calcium <unk> in the presence of varying amounts of calcium ions indicated that the absorption maximum fo calcium <unk> complex occurs at 480 nm while that of <unk> ion is at 520 nm .
the absorbance at 509 nm is independent of calcium ion concentration and , therefore , could be used to measure the total dye .
the spectra are ph dependent but constant in the range 6.5 to 7.0 .
the apparent dissociation constant of calcium <unk> is dependent upon ionic environment , ionic strength , and free calcium ion concentration .
the relationship between the apparent dissociation constant and free calcium concentration was established .
whole casein had no effect on the absorption spectra of calcium <unk> and no affinity for calcium <unk> complex or <unk> ion .
<unk> , at the concentrations employed , did not influence the dissociation fo calcium <unk> .
at ph 7.0 , ionic strength .1 , and 2 c , <unk> bound calcium as if there were 8.65 binding sites per molecule , each of pk 2.23 , corresponding to an intrinsic association constant of 168.9 liters per mole .

effect of trace elements on dissolution of hydroxyapatite by <unk> streptococci .
the effect of low levels of strontium , boron , lithium , molybdenum , and fluorine , alone and in combination , on hydroxyapatite solubility , bacterial growth , and acid production in five antigenic types of streptococcus mutans was investigated .
pour plates containing synthetic hydroxyapatite were used to compare dissolution of hydroxyapatite .
the colonies of the five antigenic types of s mutans produced zones of dissolution that were measured .
acid production and growth were studied in broth culture media .
the results show that low levels of strontium and fluorine can significantly reduce demineralization of synthetic hydroxyapatite by s mutans in vitro .

peroxisome development in the <unk> kidney of mouse .
the relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle number during differentiation of the <unk> kidney in the mouse was approached from several experimental directions .
biochemical analyses of marker enzymes for peroxisomes ( catalase and d-amino acid oxidase ) , mitochondria ( cytochrome oxidase ) and lysosomes ( acid phosphatase ) were performed on kidneys at ages from 17 days prenatal to adult .
these data were correlated with a morphometric analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in differentiating cells of the proximal tubule .
postnatal development of the <unk> kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per 100 <unk> in the proximal tubule during the first 4 weeks of postnatal growth .
elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments of er were often in close apposition .
extensive interactions between segments of er and peroxisomes were readily visible in <unk> sections viewed in the high voltage electron microscope .
in contrast to peroxisomes , neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase , suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in the proximal tubule at birth , prior to complete development of the kidney .
physiological basis of host susceptibility of florida mosquitoes to <unk> immitis .
inhibitory effects of antihistamines and <unk> on the bone marrow reactions produced by escherichia coli endotoxin in mice .
the bone marrow reactions ( that is , decrease of nucleated cell counts and increase of red blood cell counts ) of mouse bone were observed 1 hr after injection of endotoxin and peaked after 18 hr .
these reactions were significantly inhibited when diphenhydramine , promethazine ( antihistamines ) , chlorpromazine ( <unk> ) , or <unk> ( antihistamine and <unk> ) was given 30 min before endotoxin .
such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin and peaked 1 hr after administration .
the <unk> changes were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine .
these reactions were also produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin , whereas no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine or serotonin .
these results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow reactions , which then continue in the presence of further mediators .
antihistamines and <unk> are considered to hinder the whole process of reactions produced by endotoxin .

criminal exposure of physician assistants .
on the interactions between pancreatic lipase and <unk> and the substrate , and the importance of bile salts .
the interactions between pancreatic lipase and <unk> and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the <unk> phase distribution of lipase and <unk> activities .
the results suggest that lipase binds to hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation .
bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a ph of about 6.5 displace lipase from this binding , resulting in a reversible in activation .
at ph values below about 6.5 , lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt , and a low activity peak is seen around ph 5.5 .
this is the result of the binding of lipase to the `` <unk> '' and the activity of the catalytic site .
in the presence of bile salt , <unk> promotes the binding of lipase to the `` <unk> '' but not to other hydrophobic interfaces , and catalytic activity is reestablished .
kinetic data indicate that the binding between <unk> and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship .
effect of ionic strength and ionic composition of assay buffers on the interaction of thyroxine with plasma proteins .
when plasma proteins are diluted with buffer the ionic strength and ionic composition of that buffer affects the interactions between thyroxine ( t4 ) and its plasma <unk> sites .
increases in phosphate , chloride or barbiturate ion concentration from 50 to 200 mmol/l caused a significant decrease in the affinity of plasma proteins for t4 , and a concurrent increase in the concentration of unbound t4 .
these results can not be completely accounted for by changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions caused quantitatively different effects on unbound t4 concentration .
the degree of depression of t4 binding by the three anions studied was in the order barbiturate greater than chloride greater than phosphate .
the results of a systematic study on the composition of diluent buffer systems indicated that when a 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> buffer ( ph 7-4 ) was used as a plasma diluent , there were unlikely to be gross changes in the <unk> properties of plasma proteins with dilution .
the innervation of the salivary gland of the moth , manduca sexta : evidence that dopamine is the transmitter .
1. using the <unk> <unk> technique for monoamines , evidence was found for the presence of a catecholamine in the salivary gland nerves of the moth , manduca sexta .
2. the innervation was studied with the electron microscope .
only the <unk> region of the gland is innervated and the nerve endings are characteristic of <unk> terminals .
3. using a sensitive <unk> assay for catecholamines , it was found that whole salivary glands contain 0.33 <unk> dopamine but no noradrenaline .
<unk> it seems likely that dopamine mediates <unk> in the salivary gland of manduca as it does a number of other arthropods .
an electrophysiological analysis of <unk> in the sea anemone <unk> felina .
1. electrophysiological techniques have been employed to examine the nature of the response observed in the ectodermal <unk> system ( ssi ) when dissolved food substances contact the column of <unk> felina .
the response seems to consist entirely of sensory activity which may continue for periods of many minutes , provided that the stimulatory chemicals remain contacting the column .
2. the interval between each evoked pulse gradually increases as the sensory response progresses .
this does not result from fatigue in the conduction system but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation .
this may occur over a period of several minutes , which is much longer than comparable adaptation in higher animals .
3. physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the pedal disc , oral disc , tentacles and pharynx .
<unk> the basic role of the ssi in coordinating behavioural activity in sea anemones is reviewed .
it is concluded that it functions primarily as a single , <unk> unit responsible for transmitting <unk> sensory information from ectodermal chemoreceptors to ectodermal ( and perhaps endodermal ) effectors .
the selective eosinophil chemotactic activity of histamine .
histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from mixed granulocyte populations when over 20 % eosinophils were used in a modified boyden chamber chemotactic assay system .
this effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase ( <unk> ) and was generated by decarboxylation of <unk> .
a linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between 3 x 10 ( -7 ) m and 1.25 x 10 ( -6 ) m , while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils .
the attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by h-1 or h-2 receptor antagonists , however , the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by <unk> , an h-2 receptor antagonist .
the effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays : ( a ) counting cells that had traversed <unk> pore , <unk> thick polycarbonate filters , ( b ) counting cells that had migrated various distances into a <unk> pore , <unk> cellulose nitrate filters , or ( c ) measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using <unk> cells .
the ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient ; histamine did not cause a dose-dependent increase in random motility .
furthermore , <unk> of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by c5a .
it is concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils , while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration .
these observations may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate hypersensitivity reactions .
hemoglobins and <unk> : comparative aspects of structure and function .
comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by themselves , and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an <unk> physiology .
in the case of fish hemoglobins , some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems .
it appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in general .
the trout hemoglobin system is an example .
distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligand-binding mechanism .
characterization of the multiple , structurally distinct subunits of the 60s limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in understanding its function .
our studies suggest the possibility of using limulus hemocyanin and other <unk> as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays .
the rapid development of molecular structural data from x-ray <unk> combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science .
how do biological systems discriminate among physically similar ions ?
this paper reviews the history of understanding how biological systems can discriminate so strikingly among physically similar ions , especially alkali cations .
appreciation of qualitative regularities ( `` permitted sequences '' ) and quantitative regularities ( `` selectivity isotherms '' ) in ion selectivity grew first from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes , then of biological systems such as enzymes and cell membranes , and most recently of lipid bilayers doped with model pores and carriers .
discrimination of ions depends on both electrostatic and steric forces .
`` black-box '' studies on intact biological membranes have in some cases yielded molecular clues to the structure of the actual biological pores and carriers .
major current problems involve the extraction of these molecules ; how to do it , what to do when it is achieved , and how ( and if ) it is relevant to the central problems of membrane function .
further advances are expected soon from studies of rate barriers within membranes , of voltage-dependent ( `` excitable '' ) conducting channels , and of increasingly complex model systems and biological membranes .
photoreceptor processes : some problems and perspectives .
visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment ( rhodopsin ) .
visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar : the chromophore is <unk> <unk> attached by an <unk> linkage ( schiff base ) to a membrane protein , opsin .
the effect of light is to <unk> the chromophore to the <unk> configuration .
beyond these fundamental similarities , several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear .
( 1 ) light causes vertebrate visual pigments to bleach , liberating the chromophore .
most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light , but instead form a thermally stable <unk> , with the chromophore in the <unk> configuration still attached to the opsin .
( 2 ) in the disk membranes of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments , the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks .
within this plane , however , both rotational and translational diffusion are possible .
in the <unk> membranes of arthropod and cephalopod <unk> , on the other hand , the situation is less clear .
there is evidence for some preferential orientation of chromophores that implies restrictions on brownian rotation .
( 3 ) in the outer segments of vertebrate receptors , absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the plasma membrane to <unk> due to a decrease in sodium conductance , possibly mediated by calcium ions .
in most invertebrate photoreceptors , light causes a depolarization due to an increase in conductance , principally to sodium ions .
a subsequent entry of calcium causes a partial repolarization of the membrane , due to a decrease in sodium conductance .
( 4 ) for vertebrate receptors , log threshold is directly proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached ( <unk> relationship ) .
the proportionality constant varies in different preparations from less than four to more than 30 , and the physical basis for the relationship is unknown .
for invertebrates , by contrast , the dependence of sensitivity on rhodopsin concentration is much less dramatic and may well depend simply on the probability of quantum catch .
( 5 ) in most species , vertebrate and invertebrate , the accumulation of <unk> probably has no effect on membrane conductance , but several possible exceptions exist .
( 6 ) <unk> of rhodopsin from <unk> is likely an important mechanism of recovery in certain arthropods such as diurnal insects , but dark mechanisms of recovery also exist in all phyla .
in no single case are they adequately understood .
hydrolysis of the hen egg vitelline membrane by cock sperm <unk> and other enzymes .
a technique utilizing pregnant <unk> serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin treatment of hens ( gallus domesticus ) , followed by manual ovulation of the excised follicles , was developed to obtain a large number of mature ova .
the intact ova were used to test whether <unk> , partially purified from the spermatozoa of the cock ( gallus domesticus ) , partially purified rabbit testicular <unk> and commercial preparations of several hydrolytic enzymes could dissolve the inner vitelline membrane .
enzymes were applied to pieces of filter paper placed on the ovum .
cock <unk> and <unk> such as trypsin , chymotrypsin , collagenase and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas <unk> such as leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase a did not .
phospholipase a , sulfatase , <unk> , <unk> and rabbit testicular <unk> also failed to hydrolyze the membrane .
cock <unk> hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor .
the surface of the ovum over the germinal disc region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock <unk> than the surface over other regions of the ovum .
<unk> from cock sperm caused the release of <unk> acid soluble material absorbing at 280 nm from <unk> preparations of inner vitelline membranes .
hydrolysis was greatest at ph 8.0 and was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor .

some effects of low ph on chloride exchange in human red blood cells .
in order to test the range of ph values over which the <unk> carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid , chloride <unk> across human red blood cells was examined between ph 4.75 and 5.7 at 0 decrees c .
it was found that chloride <unk> flux had a minimum near ph 5 and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity .
the arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low ph values .
the chloride flux at ph 5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher ph values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared .
in addition , the extent of inhibition of chloride <unk> flux by <unk> was reduced at low ph .
our interpretation of these findings is that the <unk> flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower ph values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the <unk> species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below <unk> .
a possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell membranes as dimers of hcl at these very low ph values .
ionic properties of the acetylcholine receptor in cultured rat <unk> .
the acetylcholine reversal potential ( er ) of cultured rat <unk> is <unk> .
when activated , the receptor is permeable to <unk> and <unk> , but not to <unk> ions .
measurement of er in <unk> , <unk> medium also indicated a permeability to <unk> ions .
unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of er was insensitive to change in external <unk> ( up to 30 mm ) or to changes in external ph ( between 6.4 and 8.9 ) .
the equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries ( ek and ena ) and their respective <unk> ( gk and gna ) , which has been generally useful in describing the er of adult rat and frog muscle , could also be applied to rat <unk> when er was measured over a wide range of external <unk> concentrations .
the equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to <unk> bathed in media of different external <unk> concentrations .
in this case , the er was more closely described by the goldman constant field equation .
under certain circumstances , it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the goldman equation .
attempts to similarly manipulate the responses of cultured rat <unk> were <unk> .
these trials included a reduction in temperature ( 15 degress c ) , partial <unk> <unk> , and activation of responses with the cholinergic agonist , <unk> .
effect of <unk> on physiological parameters and on properties of myosin and sarcoplasmic reticulum of fast and slow muscles of the rabbit .
<unk> of fast ( extensor digitorum longus ) and slow ( soleus ) twitch muscles of the rabbit showed essentially complete fast to slow and slow to fast conversion , respectively , 11-12 mo after surgery with respect to a number of physiological parameters including intrinsic shortening , velocity , and isometric twitch time to peak .
there was pronounced bu incomplete biochemical conversion as judged by <unk> uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum , myosin atpase , alkali lability , and light chain complement .
the question of trophic substances of neural origin is discussed in light of the fact that chronic stimulation for 15 wk of a fast muscle produces complete biochemical and physiological conversion to the slow type .
chitin synthase in <unk> <unk> : properties , cellular location and synthesis in growing cultures .
chitin synthase of <unk> <unk> was present in the `` microsomal ' fraction ( 100 000 g precipitate ) , the <unk> ' fraction ( 2000 g precipitate ) and the <unk> ' fraction ( 10 000 g precipitate ) .
the properties of the <unk> ' enzyme were investigated .
the ph optimum was between 5-8 and 6-2 , and the temperature optimum was between 31 and 33 degrees c .
the km for udp <unk> was 1.8 mm .
the enzyme was stimulated by <unk> and a slight stimulation was also effected by <unk> .
soluble <unk> were inhibitory .
a <unk> , <unk> inhibitor of chitin synthase activity was present in the soluble cytoplasm from the mycelium .
the effects of aeration and glucose concentration on enzyme production in growing cultures were also investigated ; maximum specific activity of chitin synthase was associated with the cessation of exponential growth .

a new method is described for the efficient conversion of schizosaccharomyces pombe cells into <unk> .

when yeast cells were incubated for 4 to 8 h in yeast <unk> medium , ph 6 , containing 8 <unk> , and then plated on selective media , there was a strong induction of antibiotic-resistant mutations .
indirect evidence suggests that practically all resistant mutants selected were of independent origin .
the analysis of <unk> resistant mutants showed that most were <unk> , while those tested showed recombination with known mitochondrial markers .
our results suggest that manganese can be considered as a mutagen which specifically induces mitochondrial mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae .
the properties and large-scale production of <unk> from <unk> .
an intracellular <unk> with <unk> activity was purified from a strain of <unk> .
the optimum conditions for enzyme production by fermentation on scales up to 2700 l were investigated .
highest enzyme yield was obtained in <unk> liquor medium ( 9-2 % , w/v ) at 37 degrees c .
oxygen limitation was not necessary for high enzyme yield .
a total recovery of 4-3 % from <unk> extract and a <unk> increase in specific activity were obtained after <unk> .
the specific activity of the purified preparation was 45 <unk> protein .
the enzyme hydrolysed <unk> and l-glutamine at 7 and 5 % , respectively , of its activity toward <unk> , but <unk> activity could be demonstrated only at substrate concentrations above 5 mm .
the km values for <unk> and <unk> were 2-6 x 10 ( -5 ) and 1-4 x 10 ( -4 ) respectively .
the <unk> activity of the enzyme was demonstrated with gardner <unk> and was found only slightly less potent that <unk> , the most active <unk> so far tested in this system .
effect of inorganic phosphate on acridine inhibition and plasmid curing in escherichia coli .
some mutants and stock strains of escherichia coli k12 were sensitive to <unk> in the presence of inorganic phosphate but were resistant to <unk> in its absence .
they mutated spontaneously to resistance to <unk> plus phosphate .
the synergistic effect of phosphate on <unk> sensitivity was increased at high ph values .
genetic analysis suggested that the mutations occurred in the gene acra .
electron microscopic observation suggested that the presence of <unk> plus phosphate affected the structure of the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm under it .
this structural alteration was not caused by <unk> alone .
acridine orange plus phosphate can more effectively eliminate the plasmid <unk> than acridine orange alone .
oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane by pseudomonas <unk> .
the oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane by suspensions and ultrasonic extracts of pseudomonas <unk> was studied .
a continuous assay for the oxidation of co to co2 was devised , using o2 and co2 electrodes in combination .
<unk> of co-dependent co2 formation , o2 consumption and nadh oxidation , and the partial <unk> of <unk> nadh oxidation , suggest the involvement of a <unk> in these oxidations .
evidence is presented suggesting methane and co oxidation are catalysed by a single enzyme system , distinct , at least in part , from the nadh oxidase present in extracts .
ethanol was able to provide the reductant necessary for co oxidation by cell suspensions , though the metabolism of ethanol by p. <unk> was found unlikely to result in <unk> formation of nadh ; the means whereby alcohol oxidation could supply reductant for the <unk> are discussed .
systematic desensitization to reduce <unk> anxiety .
a modified version of systematic desensitization was used to reduce the anxiety and negative interpersonal consequences produced by a recurrent aversive dream resulting from events in the real world .
the subject , a 16-year-old incarcerated male , was first taught a standard relaxation technique .
the <unk> dream was divided into 12 hierarchical imaginal scenes .
following initial relaxation , each scene was sequentially introduced and followed by the <unk> suggestion that the subject was still very relaxed .
after three sessions with the therapists and several practice sessions by himself , the subject reported no further anxiety to the dream ( which continued to occur ) and improved relations with the institutional staff .
six months of follow-up showed no recurrence of the anxiety or the subsequent irritability which the subject had initially reported as leading to negative interpersonal relations with the staff .

experimental evaluation of the <unk> of dopamine on the basilar artery .
<unk> of the basilar artery reveal that dopamine given <unk> to dogs can generate cerebral vasospasm .
this finding supports a recent hypothesis of others that dopamine may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm , especially since many substances are known which fail to produce such spasm .
compared to blood or prostaglandin e2 , however , the spasm induced by dopamine was delayed in onset , less in incidence , and usually less intense .
possible explanations for such experimental differences are discussed .
the evolving role of the nurse and the neurosurgical <unk> assistant in the treatment of intractable pain states .
the neurosurgical nurse as a departmental assistant .
fatty acid and ketone body metabolism in the rat : response to diet and exercise .
this study was designed to measure the response of key enzymes of ketone body metabolism in heart , skeletal muscle , and liver to diet and exercise , two conditions known to influence ketone body utilization .
a 3 ( diet : control , high fat , or high carbohydrate ) x 2 ( kill condition : rested or exhausted ) x 2 ( training : trained or untrained ) factorial design was used to estimate main experimental effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables .
physical training ( treadmill running ) was associated with a doubling of the activity of skeletal muscle <unk> coa transferase , a key enzyme in <unk> ketone body utilization .
the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of liver ketone body production , <unk> coa synthetase ( hmg coa synthetase ) , was not greatly influenced by training or <unk> exercise indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of hmg coa synthetase .
feeding a high fat diet , on the other hand , significantly increased the activity of liver hmg coa synthetase , indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise .
the results of this study indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation , and that trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than untrained individuals .
some mechanisms of reduction of carotenoid levels in chickens infected with eimeria <unk> or e. tenella .
the levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels infected with eimeria <unk> or e. tenella .
the mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species , being primarily associated with interference of absorption of <unk> ( carotenoids ) from the intestinal lumen with e. <unk> infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with e. tenella infection .
chicks reared on an essentially <unk> diet and inoculated with e. <unk> showed no detectable levels of carotenoids in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of <unk> .
conversely , <unk> chicks and chicks inoculated with e. tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids .
chicks reared on a diet containing <unk> and inoculated with e. tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did <unk> controls when changed to a <unk> diet .
in chicks fed high <unk> diets containing chromic oxide , no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with e. tenella compared with <unk> controls , whereas chicks inoculated with e. <unk> showed significantly less <unk> absorption .
conversely , a marked increase in the <unk> : <unk> ratio was observed in the <unk> contents of chicks inoculated with e. tenella compared with <unk> controls or those inoculated with e. <unk> .
studies of <unk> chicks <unk> with chicks inoculated with e. <unk> or e. tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal ph are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection .
the studies involving <unk> birds with reciprocal <unk> between high and low <unk> diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin .
metabolic studies on the development of <unk> fatty liver in <unk> mice .
mechanisms involved in the development of the alcoholic fatty liver in <unk> mice were investigated .
incorporation studies using [ 14c ] acetate and [ 3h ] palmitate indicated that the half-life of hepatic triglycerides was doubled in the <unk> mice , and utilization of the exogenous fat was significantly increases as compared with that of the control .
no persistent alteration was recognized in hepatic oxidation of palmitate , as estimated by in vitro experiments using liver slices obtained from control and <unk> mice .
<unk> studies indicated that the activities of acetyl coa carboxylase , atp citrate lyase , malic enzyme , and <unk> dehydrogenase were increased with ethanol drinking .
the increment in hepatic triglycerides accumulated during ethanol ingestion was largely accounted for by <unk> , oleic , and linoleic acids .
these findings demonstrated an augmentation in hepatic <unk> as well as an increased utilization of exogenous fats .
ethanol drinking did not cause any appreciable change in plasma triglyceride level and metabolism of adipose tissue .
in summary of the present studies , accelerated <unk> and increased utilization of the dietary fats may be possible causal factors in the alcoholic fatty liver of <unk> mice .
different <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
renal response to acid loading in the developing lamb fetus , intact in utero .
response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal lambs , <unk> days gestation , in order to evaluate the renal contribution to elimination of hydrogen ion during <unk> development .
experiments were conducted on healthy <unk> fetuses , intact in utero , with catheters implanted at <unk> into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the <unk> , four or more days prior to the study .
a metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid , 15 m <unk> , intravenously over a period of 90 minutes .
serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before , during and for three hours following the infusion , for measurements of ph , bicarbonate , lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output .
during the infusion , urine ph fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later ( figs. 1 to 4 , <unk> iii to iv ) .
lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 <unk> at the end of the infusion , returning to control rates three hours later .
lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 <unk> at the end of infusion ; <unk> acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 <unk> ; the rates of excretion of lactate and <unk> acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours .
ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 <unk> three hours after the end of infusion .
the acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate .
during the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours , about 800 <unk> lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount .
the diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride , the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion ; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion .
during the 90 minutes of infusion , blood ph fell from 7.36 to 7.13 , base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 meq/l and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 <unk> ; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood pco2 and po2 ( figs. 1 to 2 , <unk> i to ii ) .
during the following three hours of recovery , ph rose gradually to 7.29 , base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 meq/l and 8.7 <unk> respectively .
since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small , the decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as placental transfer .
these experiments indicate that , in the lamb fetus , intact in utero , the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms , is capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to fetal homeostasis .
the increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss of sodium and chloride in the urine .
recognition and significance of <unk> fetal acidosis during intensive monitoring of labor .
<unk> monitoring and <unk> of fetal blood are mutually complementary procedures , and optimal knowledge of the fetal state is achieved by making use of both , the former for the preliminary screening of all cases at risk and the latter for the purpose of deciding on obstetric management where pathological changes are evident in the <unk> .
the major difficulty in obtaining a precise value for the fetal acid-base balance lies in the occurence of `` falsely abnormal '' cases , i.e. cases in which the fetal ph falls during labor but the clinical condition at birth is good ( apgar greater than or equal to 7 ) .
in our own series the incidence of such cases among fetuses at risk was 11.2 % ( <unk> i ) .
in the majority of these cases the fetal acidosis is thought to be a result of increased metabolic acidosis in the mother ( <unk> fetal metabolic acidosis ) .
the importance of the <unk> fetal acidosis during labor lies in the fact that unless it is recognised , rapid extraction of the fetus will appear necessary on clinical grounds , although it is in fact unnecessary , since this form of acidosis has no adverse effect on the fetus .
various parameters have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of the <unk> fetal acidosis .
these include the <unk> difference in base deficit ( <unk> <unk> ) , the <unk> differences in <unk> 40 ( <unk> <unk> 40 ) the <unk> difference actual ph ( <unk> actual <unk> ) , and the <unk> difference in base deficit of the <unk> fluid ( <unk> <unk> ) .
a critical analysis of these parameters has been carried out on the results of <unk> performed during a 5 year period ( 1968-1972 ) at the first clinic of obstetrics and gynecology of milan university .
the cases comprised 59 regarded as normal ( normal course of pregnancy , spontaneous commencement of labor at term , clear amniotic fluid , regular <unk> , spontaneous birth , apgar at 90 sec between 8 and 10 , weight at birth greater than 2500 g ) , and 335 considered to be at risk ( maternal disease , presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid and/or abnormal changes in <unk> ) .
in all of these cases the <unk> was recorded by <unk> , and the tracings were interpreted according to hon .
<unk> of blood were taken from both mother and fetus during labor and the following determinations were carried out : actual ph , <unk> 40 , hb concentration , hemoglobin oxygen saturation , base deficit <unk> ( <unk> ) .
the <unk> differences were then calculated .
the same determinations were carried out on samples of maternal blood and of arterial and venous cord blood taken immediately after delivery .
the clinical condition of the infant was evaluated by the apgar score at 90 seconds after birth .
<unk> and stabilization of the cytotoxic agent <unk> .
kinetic studies were carried out on the ring opening of the quaternary nitrogen cation , <unk> ion ( i ) , to yield <unk> ( iii ) , on the cyclization of iii to yield i , and on a photochemical reaction undergone by i in aqueous solutions exposed to visible light .
from the results , it was concluded that : ( a ) i and iii are in facile equilibrium in aqueous solution but appreciable amounts of iii do not exist in dilute solutions with ph values below 10 : ( b ) the photochemical reaction of i in water ( presumably a <unk> ) can be reversed by <unk> , by <unk> , and by increasing the ph of solutions to values greater than 12 ; ( c ) the photochemical reaction of i can be inhibited by protecting the aqueous solutions from visible light , and the rate in the presence of light can be reduced by increasing the concentration of i in the solution ; and ( d ) although the chloride and <unk> salts of i react identically and have similar <unk> in water , it is possible to prepare more concentrated and , hence , more stable solutions of the <unk> salt by including sodium hydroxide in the solvent .
the solubility of <unk> chloride remains about the same in dilute sodium hydroxide as in water .
<unk> of a substituted <unk> , <unk> .
hydrolysis of <unk> to form <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> was followed <unk> in aqueous solutions at temperatures between 37 and <unk> , ph values up to 7.6 , and an ionic strength of 0.2 .
the effects of acetate , formate , and phosphate buffers as well as ionic strength on the observed rate constants were investigated .
an interesting nonlinear dependency of the kobs with buffer concentration was noted .
the velocity constants declined with increasing <unk> concentration ; the log <unk> profile and rate law are given along with other relevant data .
complexation in formulation of parenteral solutions : <unk> of the cytotoxic agent <unk> by complexation with <unk> acid species .
the apparent solubility of <unk> in aqueous solutions suitable for intravenous use was increased by complexation with <unk> acid .
studies were carried out in the ph 0-8 range .
<unk> <unk> did not form complexes with the <unk> ion , while the <unk> ion appeared to form several different complexes with both the <unk> ion and <unk> acid .
two different solid complexes were isolated and characterized .
the solubility increases observed at ph <unk> are described by mathematical relationships involving the stability constants of some postulated complex species .
from these results , <unk> formulations for use as parenteral solutions are proposed .
the increase in the apparent aqueous solubility of <unk> in such formulations may range from <unk> to <unk> , depending upon the ph and total <unk> concentrations .
inhibitory effect of <unk> sodium <unk> on trypsin activity .
the inhibitory effect of <unk> sodium <unk> on the proteolytic activity of trypsin was investigate over the ph 6-8 range .
the <unk> activity was determined using two different substrates : casein and n , <unk> hydrochloride .
the mechanistic studies revealed the <unk> interaction to be the overall major mechanism of inhibition .
this interaction was shown to involve substrate depletion , probably involving some primary sites of the natural substrate casein .
some inhibition was also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the <unk> molecules .
the interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the substrate were irreversible .
the possible therapeutic significance of the inhibitory effect of the surfactant is discussed .
in vitro adsorption of <unk> hydrochloride on activated charcoal and its relationship to pharmacological effects of drug in vivo .
the adsorption of <unk> hydrochloride , a potent <unk> agent , on activated charcoal powder was studied in vitro .
langmuir adsorption isotherms were established at ph 4 and 7 , and the maximum adsorption capacity of charcoal for this drug was estimated using these values .
activated charcoal modified the bioavailability of <unk> hydrochloride in vivo .
the <unk> action of <unk> in the mouse was strongly inhibited in the presence of activated charcoal .
a comparative evaluation of charcoal and chromium oxide used as inert , <unk> markers revealed that chromium oxide may be the marker of <unk> in gi transit studies in laboratory animals since it does not influence the bioavailability of <unk> hydrochloride .
binding of bile acids to <unk> at gastric ph conditions .
the binding of bile salts to <unk> was studied under varying conditions of ph and added electrolyte .
the <unk> bile salts were strongly absorbed by the <unk> resin at low ph and in the presence of chloride anions .
<unk> acid binding was very weak at low ph but increased strongly with increasing ph .
the presence of chloride ions strongly decreased the amount of <unk> bound by the <unk> resin .
group contribution data obtained by <unk> extraction of prostaglandin b2 with aliphatic amines .
<unk> accumulation by mouse erythrocytes infected with plasmodium <unk> .
[ 14c ] <unk> accumulation by washed erythrocyte preparations was characterized to permit comparisons with chloroquine accumulation .
erythrocytes infected with plasmodium <unk> cs ( <unk> ) accumulate <unk> by a saturable process that has an apparent dissociation constant for <unk> of 7.6 x 10 ( -8 ) m and is competitively inhibited by chloroquine , quinine and quinacrine , as is the process of chloroquine accumulation .
within experimental error , the k1 of 8 x 10 ( -7 ) m estimated for chloroquine is the same regardless of whether the drug being accumulated is [ 14c ] <unk> or [ 14c ] chloroquine .
likewise , the k1 for <unk> is the same regardless of which drug is being accumulated .
in addition , glucose stimulates and hydrogen ion , cold or interruption of glycolysis inhibits <unk> as well as chloroquine accumulation .
these findings are evidence that a single process serves to accumulate both drugs .
in the absence of substrate , erythrocytes infected with p. <unk> cr ( <unk> ) accumulate twice as much <unk> as chloroquine , and they accumulate more <unk> than do erythrocytes infected with p. <unk> cs .
these differences occur because p. <unk> cr infects <unk> erythrocytes possessing a high-affinity , <unk> process of accumulation to which <unk> has greater access than chloroquine .
in the presence of glucose , <unk> accumulation by erythrocytes infected with p. <unk> cr , when plotted as a function of <unk> concentration in the medium , describes a sigmoid curve .
the neurochemistry of <unk> disease : effect of l-dopa therapy .
post-mortem brain material from control and <unk> disease patients was examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine the mechanism of action of l-dopa as a therapeutic agent .
the activities of <unk> amino acid decarboxylase ( dopa d ) , tyrosine hydroxylase , monoamine oxidase and <unk> transferase were examined ; in addition the tissue levels of dopa , <unk> , dopamine ( da ) and <unk> acid ( hva ) were determined .
in the <unk> parkinsonian patients , the greatest decreases were detected for striatal da and dopa d , with <unk> acid and tyrosine hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change .
the activities of monoamine oxidase and <unk> transferase in the striatal nuclei were not different from the controls .
the putamen was consistently the most severely affected region .
dopa and <unk> were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients treated with l-dopa shortly before death .
the mean concentrations of da in the striatum of these patients were 1 ) 9 to 15 times higher than those in <unk> patients , 2 ) related to the time before death of the last dose of l-dopa and 3 ) greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as `` good responders '' as compared to `` poor responders . ''
although l-dopa therapy increased <unk> acid levels in all brain areas , a preferential increase was observed in the striatum .
it was concluded that <unk> principal therapeutic effects in <unk> disease are consistent with its transformation to da in the striatum .
studies on the mechanism of depletion of striatal dopamine by <unk> .
these experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine ( da ) in the striatum produced by <unk> ( <unk> ) .
<unk> ( <unk> ) , the metabolite of <unk> , appears to be the active <unk> agent , since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before <unk> markedly reduced both the formation of <unk> and the depletion of da .
after injection of <unk> ( 100 mg/kg i.p. ) , the striatal concentration of <unk> acid ( hva ) rose by 41 % at 1 hour .
this is probably due to an increase in da metabolism , since <unk> markedly enhanced the decline of da produced by <unk> ( <unk> ) .
at 2 , 3 and 4 hours after <unk> , the concentration of hva and <unk> acid was below control level .
the decrease in <unk> acid is due partially to a decreased formation of <unk> acid from da .
in striatal slices , both <unk> and <unk> decreased the formation of <unk> and the accumulation of <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> did not alter the specific activity of <unk> or release <unk> from the slices , but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal <unk> at low concentrations of tyrosine ( 10 mum ) .
<unk> released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated <unk> from striatal slices .
at low concentrations of <unk> , the percent reduction in <unk> was much greater than the percentage of <unk> released into the medium .
however , at higher concentrations , the inhibition of <unk> reached a maximum while <unk> release kept increasing .
these results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and da release from storage sites by <unk> may account for the depletion of da produced by the injection of <unk> .
characteristics of gastric inhibition by acidification of <unk> gland area .
1. gastric acid responses to the test meals were measured in the <unk> pouch , gastric and pancreatic fistula dogs , using the <unk> titration method , and monitoring the rate at which a solution of 1-0 <unk> had to be added to maintain the ph of the gastric content constant at pre-selected values ranging from 5-0 to 1-0 .
in this way the ph profile of the gastric acid and pepsin responses to a liver extract meal kept in the <unk> pouch or gastric fistula as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine , <unk> or <unk> could be determined .
2. a liver extract meal adjusted to ph 5-0 produced a potent and <unk> stimulation of acid secretion from the <unk> pouch without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the serum concentration of <unk> gastrin .
3. graded decrease of the liver extract meal ph to below 5-0 resulted in the <unk> inhibition of gastric acid output , which at ph 1-0 was only about 30 % of the value attained at ph 5-0 .
acid secretion from the <unk> pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as histamine , <unk> or <unk> also showed gradual decrease when the ph of the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from 5-0 to 1-0 .
this <unk> inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion .
<unk> the <unk> inhibition of the <unk> pouch response to the liver extract meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine , secretin or <unk> , which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the liver meal .
5. the results indicate that there is a local and <unk> inhibition mechanism of gastric acid secretion activated by an acidified meal making contact with the <unk> gland area .
the influence of ph on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve fibres of rana esculenta .
1. the experiments were done on single nodes of ranvier of rana esculenta .
the effects of tetrodotoxin and h ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise , va , of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak na permeability , pna .
2. with the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant , kt , of the <unk> reaction at neutral ph was determined to be 2-8 nm .
between 1-55 and 15-5 nm tetrodotoxin the normalized value , a , of va , was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration ct = [ ttx ] <unk> nm by the empirical equation log [ ( 1-a ) <unk> ] = 1-22 log <unk> 3 .
on increasing the ph ( up to 8-8 ) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in a .
the apparent reduction of ct ( as calculated from a ) suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms .
<unk> weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions ( 7-3 less than ph less than or equal to 5-5 ) reduced a to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid ph on a ( a = 0-5 at about ph 5-5 ) .
in more acid toxin solutions a decreased again and at ph 4-6 it was about equal to the value in <unk> solution .
5. when , after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution , the <unk> was suddenly changed to neutral ringer solution a jumped to a higher value a ' as measured 1 sec after the switch .
since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of 1 min , a ' reflects the number of na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid ph .
<unk> in acid <unk> solution the peak pna as obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor ( ch + 1 ) -1 with ch = [ <unk> ] <unk> ( e ) and kh ( e ) = <unk> mum exp ( <unk> <unk> ) .
adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor <unk> 7 .
experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration ( <unk> nm ) and ph values ( <unk> ) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low ph .
moreover , <unk> was smaller ( the additional toxin effect larger ) when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus ch reduced during equilibration .
this suggests that tetrodotoxin cations and h ions compete for the same blocking site .
a quantitative fit , however , requires additional assumptions .
the influence of ph on the rate of tetrodotoxin action on myelinated nerve fibres .
1. the experiments were done on single myelinated nerve fibres of rana esculenta .
the rates of toxin effect were studied either by measuring the maximum rate of rise , va , of repetitively evoked action potentials or by measuring na currents during periodic impulses in the voltage clamp .
2. va measurements showed that in alkaline solutions ( ph up to 8-8 ) the offset rate was unchanged while the onset was slowed in quantitative agreement with an assumed decrease in the active cationic form of tetrodotoxin .
3. both va measurements and those in the voltage clamp revealed a decrease in <unk> , the offset time constant and in increase in the onset time constant , <unk> , as the ph was lowered .
<unk> for tetrodotoxin concentrations , [ ttx ] , up to 400 nm and ph values down to 5-3 the simple relation <unk> = <unk> held , where <unk> is the constant factor by which the na permeability was reduced at equilibrium with a given [ ttx ] .
5. the agreement between kinetic and equilibrium results was also valid when , at constant [ ttx ] and ph .
<unk> was modified by the holding potential during equilibration .
<unk> no unequivocal explanation of the results can be given but some of their features resemble acid catalysis .
the formation of synapses in amphibian striated muscle during development .
1. a study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing <unk> and <unk> amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal ( <unk> ) or a distributed ( sartorius ) innervation from <unk> plaque ' nerve terminals using histological , ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques .
2. during the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog , the sartorius <unk> increased in length at about twice the rate of the <unk> <unk> , due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon .
3. the short <unk> and sartorius <unk> of young tadpoles ( 800 mum long ) possessed only a single synapse and the <unk> <unk> did not receive any further innervation during development .
however the sartorius <unk> received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion , until the distance between the original synapse formed on the <unk> and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about 12 <unk> 4 .
during development synapses possessed either skewed , multimodal , or unimodal <unk> <unk> distributions ; the intervals between <unk> were not distributed randomly according to a poisson process , as <unk> of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals ; the <unk> <unk> had a similar <unk> distribution as the <unk> if these had a unimodal distribution .
5. reinnervation or <unk> of the sartorius and the <unk> muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles , as found in the control muscles of the contralateral and <unk> legs .
<unk> these observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during development the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation ; thus during reinnervation or <unk> of adult muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites .
comparative studies of trypanosoma <unk> battaglia and trypanosoma <unk> bettencourt & franca .
in <unk> blood agar media trypanosoma <unk> developed spheroid clusters as compared to rather long , <unk> ( sometimes branched ) clusters formed by trypanosoma <unk> .
the former species attained a greater population density ( approximately 6 x 10 ( 7 ) <unk> ) than the latter ( approximately 2 x 10 ( 7 ) <unk> ) .
greater numbers of <unk> , some in active binary divisions , were observed during the logarithmic phase of growth , and morphologic changes occurred during cultivation which correlated with increased acidity and a depletion of glucose .
maximum numbers of <unk> forms were found during the stationary and early death phases .
most of the forms observed after 20 days were <unk> .
glucose concentrations decreased to 0 m in t. <unk> and to 4.4 x 10 ( -5 ) m in t. <unk> cultures during the stationary and death phases .
by the 12th day of incubation cultures of t. <unk> were more acid ( ph 5.5 ) than those of t. <unk> <unk> and t. <unk> contained common and specific antigens .
at least 2-3 common antigens were detected in extracts reacted against heterologous <unk> .
specific antigens were observed as <unk> lines formed by extracts reacted against homologous and heterologous <unk> and with <unk> absorbed with heterologous antigens .
at least 2 specific antigens were evident in extracts of t. <unk> and 1 in extracts of t. <unk> .
the use of psychotropic drugs in general practice .
a report of a <unk> survey .
all the psychotropic tablets prescribed by a general practitioner in one year are <unk> .
the patients who received them are separated into diagnostic groups and their treatment is analysed by the number of attendances , prescriptions , and duration of therapy .
hospital referrals and overdoses over a longer period are recorded .
my policy in psychiatric conditions is indicated .
<unk> derivatives of dopamine and <unk> .
secondary and tertiary amino homologs of the title compounds have been prepared , bearing an <unk> group .
in peripheral evaluation , certain members of the series exhibited beta-adrenergic agonist effects of lower activity than <unk> .
<unk> exhibited marked properties consistent with its being an alpha agonist , and it is concluded that introduction of considerable bulk about the nitrogen of a catecholamine does not a priori destroy <unk> effects .
the compounds qualitatively paralleled the effects of dopamine in assays based upon direct <unk> administration in rats , although they were less potent than dopamine .

apparent values of km and vmax have been measured for catalysis of hydrolysis of <unk> egg lecithin liposomes , activated through addition of 0.4 m <unk> , by <unk> a2 from bee and snake venoms and by phospholipase c from clostridium <unk> as a function of the concentration of three surfactants : <unk> , <unk> bromide , and <unk> phosphate .
for all three enzymes , values of km and vmax show little or no dependence on the concentration of these ionic surfactants , demonstrating that the liposomal surface charge is not a crucial factor in determining susceptibility to <unk> hydrolysis .
negative potential level in the outer layer of the toad skin .
the isolated skin of the toad bufo marinus <unk> when impaled from the outer surface by glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m kcl shows a voltage profile which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement .
the superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution ( pdi ) is negative with <unk> solution on both sides of the skin , displaying a minimum of <unk> mv at <unk> mum .
null value is obtained at <unk> mum , with positive values for deeper <unk> .
indications of cell <unk> ( abrupt voltage and resistance jumps ) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface .
measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution , made with <unk> and double-barreled microelectrodes , showed great discrepancies , which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum corneum .
pdi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of <unk> or <unk> concentration in the external solution , increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration .
substitution of na by k in the external solution had only minor effects on pdi .
acidification of the external solution from ph 9 is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of pdi .
at ph 3 pdi was positive .
pdi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to kcl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the stratum corneum .
differences in k and cl mobilities , responsible for the origin of pdi , were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum , with density and polarity determined by their degree of <unk> , controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution .
skin potential , short-circuit current and their relationship to pdi were discussed .
the avian erythrocyte : a study of fixation for electron microscopy .
the quality of ultrastructural preservation of the avian erythrocyte achieved using various fixation techniques is evaluated .
different combinations of initial <unk> , buffers and <unk> procedures were tested as well as variations in fixative osmolarity , ph and temperature .
of the commonly used initial <unk> ( glutaraldehyde , acrolein and formaldehyde ) , 2 % glutaraldehyde , alone in a slightly hypertonic buffer containing divalent ions , produced optimum erythrocyte preservation .
the osmolarity was balanced using a <unk> such as a sucrose .
the addition of 12 % <unk> glycol to the buffer solutions also improves erythrocyte preservation , as evidenced by the increased stability of the marginal microtubules , microfilaments and proteinaceous material .
the use of spurr <unk> epoxy resin enables the cells to be collected using low gravitational centrifugation .

hemoglobin solution and the <unk> dissociation curve .
1 ) a study was carried out to determine the <unk> dissociation curve of <unk> hemoglobin solution and factors which influence it , ( ph ; 2,3 dpg ) .
2 ) to simulate acute volume replacement , dilution experiments , in vitro , were performed employing both hemoglobin solution and <unk> lactate in whole blood .
3 ) it was determined that <unk> hemoglobin solution has a <unk> <unk> dissociation curve which responds to ph change but not to the addition of 2,3 dpg .
4 ) the <unk> effect of hemoglobin solution when mixed with whole blood in volumes up to 50 % was to <unk> the <unk> curve , unlike the effect of <unk> lactate ( no change ) .
5 ) this may have importance in the hemodynamic compensatory response to acute <unk> anemia .
effect of <unk> and ganglionic blocking agents upon increased capillary permeability following burn trauma .
tiny ( 0.2 % tbs ) , partial thickness , non-contact radiant heat burns in guinea pigs resulted , within 3 hours , in significant edema formation and protein leakage at the site of the injury .
areas of skin distant to the burn also showed an increase in water content but no protein leakage .
pretreatment of the animals with either <unk> hydrochloride or a mixture of <unk> and <unk> significantly decreased <unk> edema formation and protein leakage .
liquid emulsion autoradiography revealed that leakage of protein occurs primarily in the areas of skin adjacent to the <unk> <unk> .
the studies suggest that : the increase in vascular permeability that occurs as a consequence of burn injuries is <unk> mediated ; albumin leakage is limited to the injured tissues ; and histamine , serotonin , and presumably catecholamines play significant roles in the development of this phenomenon .
bacteriophage t4 baseplate components .
ii .
binding and location of <unk> dihydrofolate reductase .
the location of <unk> <unk> dihydrofolate reductase ( dfr ) has been determined in intact and incomplete phage particles .
it has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr ( <unk> ) <unk> <unk> phage particles .
the structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled .
morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11 protein on their <unk> was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr , such as antibodies to dfr .
further , cofactor molecules for dfr , such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene 11 product .
on the other hand , inhibitors of dfr , such as adenosine <unk> , stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein .
it has been concluded that the <unk> dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene 11 protein .
the properties of phage particles produced after infection of the <unk> host with the one known <unk> mutant containing a nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles contained a partial polypeptide , which was large enough to serve as a structural element .
<unk> virus contains an rna polymerase .
an rna-dependent rna polymerase activity has been found associated with <unk> virions .
the enzyme activity is expressed only after disrupting the virions with the nonionic detergent triton <unk> and is absolutely dependent on <unk> , whereas <unk> is not required , a finding that distinguishes this polymerase from those of other enveloped <unk> rna viruses .
within the range ph 7.2 to 8.5 no distinct optimum was found .
the optimum temperature was between 37 and 40 c .
the reaction was not inhibited by <unk> d , rifampin , or dnase , whereas rnase was completely inhibitory .
the partially <unk> product consisted of rather small-sized rna , which contained sequences complementary to <unk> virus rna as shown by hybridization to the template l , m , and s rna species of <unk> virus .

radiographic examination of mandibular lesions in barren-ground caribou .
dental anomalies were observed in 43 of 1,226 barren-ground caribou ( rangifer tarandus <unk> ) taken between 1966 and 1968 .
in five of these 43 animals , the mandibles had deformities which radiography showed to be the result of dental abscesses in four cases and probably of a trauma in the other .
the absence of <unk> lesions of the jaw bones of these 1,226 animals , and of more than 500 examined previously , indicates that `` lumpy jaw '' is rare in barren-ground caribou .
the authors suggest the use of radiography to determine the nature of bone growth on skeletal remains , in the absence of soft tissues for examination for actinomyces , either microscopically or by cultural methods .

experimental diarrhea in <unk> monkeys by oral administration with clostridium perfringens type a viable cells or enterotoxin .
purified c. perfringens type a enterotoxin fed orally in an amount of 5 mg caused both vomiting and diarrhea in the monkey only when the gastric juice had been neutralized .
exposure of enterotoxin to ph 4.0 or below rapidly destroyed the activity .
all three monkeys receiving sodium bicarbonate and 2.4 x 10 ( 10 ) viable cells grown in ds medium developed diarrhea , and only one of them vomited once .
the diarrhea lasted for 13 , 18 and 19 hr .
the symptoms were similar to those reported in human cases of c. perfringens food poisoning .
these results have verified the general notion that c. perfringens food poisoning should be categorized as a true `` <unk> intoxication '' .
the reversed passive hemagglutination test detected enterotoxin directly in most fecal samples .
this method may be applicable for diagnosis of human cases of c. perfringens food poisoning .
neither enterotoxin nor <unk> was detected in serum samples taken from any monkey up to 21 days after the challenge .
we are tempted to conclude , therefore , that no significant amount of c. perfringens enterotoxin is absorbed from the intestine .

[ effect of peripheral <unk> on the body of an animal with intact heart ] .
the effect of lasting peripheral <unk> upon the <unk> and the main biochemical factors of the blood was studied in 14 dogs with intact hearts .
in cases of significant tachycardia <unk> in a 1:2 regimen results in only a partial reduction of the resistance to the cardiac output .
this does not always permit to prevent the formation of the phenomenon of an elevated myocardial contractility .
the haemodynamic conditions are most optimal in a 1:1 regimen of <unk> .
slowing down of the cardiac rhythm was achieved by means of hypothermia .
[ regulation of interrelation between pulmonary ventilation and circulation ] .
in acute experiments on 92 cats anesthetized with urethane and kept under controlled respiration the mechanism of tonic activity of the pulmonary vessels was studied in the presence of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli .
the <unk> of the pulmonary vessels was recorded during <unk> of the vessels of the posterior lobe of the left lung by means of a perfusion pump .
simultaneously , the pressure in the common carotid artery was recorded and the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured .
pharmacological analysis was used for the study of the mechanism of the pressor reaction of the pulmonary vessels under hypoxic <unk> , and it demonstrated that the pression of the pulmonary vessels that develops under alveolar <unk> is less distinct under the effect of the <unk> agent <unk> , as well as the <unk> agents papaverine and <unk> .
the above reaction was significantly inhibited by the blocking agents of the <unk> and <unk> structures -- <unk> , morphine and novocain , and it was completely lacking against the background of the action of <unk> and <unk> -- blocking agents of <unk> and <unk> structures .
it can be supposed that the <unk> and <unk> , and probably also the <unk> structures participate in the regulation of the interrelationship of ventilation and pulmonary circulation .

multiple cyclic nucleotide <unk> in rat kidney .
using <unk> chromatography and agarose gel filtration we have partially purified a low km cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) phosphodiesterase from the 100,000 x g supernatant of rat kidneys .
the characteristics of this enzyme included a km of approximately 4 mum a ph optimum of around 8.0 and a requirement for magnesium .
this preparation should be suitable for investigation of possible effects of hormones , drugs and cellular constituents on the cyclic amp pathway through any direct effects on the low km enzyme .
we have also demonstrated a nonspecific , high km cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and possibly a specific cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( gmp ) phosphodiesterase in the soluble fraction from rat kidneys .
effect on aging on plasma renin and aldosterone in normal man .
the influence of aging on the <unk> system was evaluated by comparing young ( 20 to 30 yr ) with elderly ( 62 to 70 yr ) healthy subjects .
despite comparable body <unk> balance in the two age groups , serum renin concentration , plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly .
the age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake ; when upright and during sodium depletion , they were more pronounced .
inverse <unk> pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion ( r = -- 0.44 and -- 0.47 , respectively ) , but not during progressive sodium depletion .
plasma renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure .
aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly .
it is concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin , with parallel lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations .

[ immune mechanisms in uremia ] .
there is both clinical and experimental evidence that cellular and humoral immunity are suppressed in patients with renal insufficiency : observations in organ transplantation and in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes from <unk> patients , investigations of acute and late hypersensitivity reactions , the immune response after active immunization as well as changes of immunoglobulins and lymphatic organs in <unk> are discussed in the paper .
the underlying mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood .
<unk> , atrophy of the thymus gland , toxic serum factors , induction of enhancing mechanisms by certain serum fractions and metabolic defects of lymphocytes -- all were shown to be involved or at least considered to be .
at present , however , it is impossible to define their rank of importance and the exact place they may occupy in the genesis of this type of `` natural immunosuppression '' .
improvement of renin determination in human plasma using a commonly available renin standard in a <unk> method .
unlabelled : a new method for the measurement of renin in human plasma is described .
the method is based on the introduction of the internationally available renin standard of the medical research council ( mrc ) london , as a calibration system .
thus , some principal disadvantages of methods expressing results in renin reaction velocity ( angiotensin generation rate ) only are avoided .
both <unk> , unknown and standard , react with a sheep substrate preparation and are handled identically throughout the whole procedure including the angiotensin i <unk> ( ria ) .
the plasma renin concentration ( prc ) is given in 10 ( -6 ) <unk> units ( <unk> ) .
results : the renin standard is free of angiotensin , <unk> , and <unk> ; it is stable on storage .
identical enzyme kinetics are shown for both <unk> .
an interference between endogenous and exogenous substrate could be avoided .
the potentially harmful influences of proteins from the enzyme incubation mixture of the ria dose response curve are shown .
the use of an angiotensin i calibration system could be omitted .
using a standard renin dilution from <unk> <unk> also the full biological range is covered .
when giving an unrestricted diet the preliminary normal values of prc are 21.9 <unk> 12.6 <unk> in recumbent and 40.1 <unk> 19.8 <unk> in upright position ( n = 16 , x <unk> s , age 20-35 years ) .
earlier findings of <unk> of prc were confirmed .
[ validity of ph measurements by means of micro ph combination electrodes in blood and other biological fluids ( <unk> transl ) ] .
ph measurements in blood or in media containing either proteins or polypeptides and performed by means of micro ph combination electrodes type n 58 ( schott & gen. , mainz ) yield in a systematic error according to the regression line y = 1.135 chi - <unk> , in the range between ph 5.3 and 8.3 .
this deviation from the real ph value is independent of the protein concentration and amounts to <unk> ph units in the physiological range .
the error does not occur if the ph measurements are performed in media which are free of proteins and polypeptides , respectively .
if the electrolyte solution within the reference electrode is replaced ( nacl solution instead of kcl solution ) the error is distinctly reduced .
for this reason , this deviation should be caused by the variation of the diffusion potential across the platinum junctions .
[ glutathione ( <unk> transl ) ] .
glutathione plays an important role in biology and medicine .
most cells of plants and animals contain high concentrations of reduced glutathione and a much smaller amount of oxidised glutathione .
gsh is important for several metabolic functions of live cells , e.g. the protection of oxidative stress by peroxides , mediation of enzyme reactions , regulation of metabolic events , transport of amino acids across cell membranes via the <unk> cycle , elimination of foreign compounds by <unk> , release of neurotransmitter substances .
irreversible perturbations of the glutathione metabolism may be the reason for severe clinical symptoms of hemolytic anemia or , perhaps , of central nervous disease .

regional study of acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties in the normal human brain at various ages .
acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties were studied at various ages in the normal human brain .
in csf and four brain regions , the inferior olive , the cerebellar cortex , the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex were thus beta-galactosidase , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and acid phosphatase biochemically <unk> at ages varying between 2 and 89 years of age .
also the membrane latency for acid phosphatase was studied in these regions .
no major regional quantitative differences were found with regard to the enzymes studied .
their kinetic properties were also defined .
there appeared to exist a regional and <unk> variation in lysosomal membrane permeability .
there was , however , no age related increase in total enzyme contents .

ii .
cell-mediated immune activity .
the late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cell-mediated immunity in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in the aging process .
results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge , graft-versus-host reaction ( <unk> ) , <unk> response to pha , a thymus derived t <unk> plant mitogen , and <unk> activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity .
in vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in <unk> mice , whereas those treated with cortisone , cyclophosphamide and sublethal x-ray remain unchanged .
spleen cells from only the <unk> and the <unk> irradiated mice show reduced activity in the <unk> .
no difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells .
results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies .
thus spleen cells from <unk> or <unk> irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to pha , whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups .
hence , surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age .
furthermore , the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span .

l-tyrosine : 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase induction by hydrocortisone in the thymus of the white rat .
hydrocortisone <unk> within 4 hours after in vivo administration produced an increase in precursor <unk> into rat thymus rna and proteins in the whole animal .
from these results , together with information obtained from measurements of the tyrosine aminotransferase activity and the action of <unk> c administered one hour before the injection of hydrocortisone , it can be concluded that the increase in tissue level of the enzyme , consequent to hydrocortisone treatment , results from an increased rate of biosynthesis of the enzyme , which participates in the catabolic processes of proteins in glucocorticoid sensitive thymus cells .
identification of the 30 s protein adjacent to peptidyl transferase catalytic center of escherichia coli ribosomes .

although anticholinergic drugs alone inhibited acid secretion by only 0 to 35 per cent in these patients , the combination of <unk> and anticholinergic markedly prolonged the inhibitory effect of <unk> .

histamine receptors in the vasculature of the rabbit ear .
histamine has a dual action on the isolated perfused ear preparation of the rabbit .
the amine induced a dose-dependent rise in perfusion pressure when the preparation was perfused with krebs ' solution .
this pressor response was reversed to a depressor effect when <unk> was added to the perfusion fluid .
this depressor effect of the amine was also <unk> .
<unk> competitively inhibited the depressor effect of histamine .
prior treatment of the ear vessels with <unk> alone caused an increase in <unk> perfusion pressure .
from these results it was concluded that the predominant pressor effect of histamine on the vascular bed of the rabbit ear is mediated through the <unk> and the depressor effect of the amine through histamine <unk> .
relative <unk> and postsynaptic potencies of <unk> agonists in the rabbit pulmonary artery .
the rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic <unk> which <unk> smooth muscle contraction ; its noradrenergic nerves contain presynaptic <unk> which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter evoked by nerve impulses .
dose-response curves for the <unk> and postsynaptic effects of eight <unk> agonists were determined on <unk> strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine , corticosterone and <unk> .
1. according to the concentrations which caused 20 % of the maximal contraction ( <unk> post ) , the postsynaptic rank order of potency was : adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than phenylephrine greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> .
the <unk> values of <unk> <unk> , phenylephrine , <unk> and <unk> were 7.43 , 7.48 , 7.59 and 7.69 , respectively .
2. for the investigation of presynaptic effects , the arteries were <unk> with <unk> .
all agonists inhibited the overflow of tritium evoked by <unk> sympathetic nerve stimulation .
according to the concentrations which reduced the <unk> overflow by 20 % ( <unk> pre ) , the rank order of potency was : adrenaline greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than <unk> greater than noradrenaline greater than <unk> greater than phenylephrine greater than <unk> .
10 ( -5 ) m <unk> shifted the presynaptic dose-response curves for <unk> and <unk> to the right .
3. the ratio <unk> <unk> post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative <unk> and presynaptic potency .
according to the ratios , the agonists were arbitrarily classified into three groups .
group 1 ( ratio about 30 : preferentially postsynaptic agonists ) comprised <unk> and phenylephrine ; group 2 ( ratio near 1 ; similar <unk> and postsynaptic potencies ) comprised noradrenaline , adrenaline and <unk> ; group 3 ( ratio below 0.2 ; preferentially presynaptic agonists ) comprised <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( as well as clonidine ) .
<unk> preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the <unk> response to nerve stimulation .
<unk> and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced , but never reduced , the response .
in contrast , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency ( <unk> ) .
5. it is concluded that <unk> agonists vary widely in their relative <unk> and postsynaptic potencies , possibly because of structural differences between <unk> and postsynaptic <unk> .
<unk> and postsynaptic components contribute to their <unk> postsynaptic <unk> in actively transmitting synapses .
the preferential activation of presynaptic <unk> results in <unk> inhibition of synaptic transmission .

<unk> ( np ) , <unk> ( om ) , st <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> -- and st 1697 -- <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) <unk> -- were 3 to 5 times more potent in <unk> respect <unk> clonidine ( clon ) whereas st 363 -- <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> -- and <unk> ( xy ) exerted only <unk> 1/20 the effect of that of clonidine .
<unk> activity after i.v. injection was tested by the <unk> effect in <unk> rats ; st 1697 , st 363 and xy were active , <unk> <unk> of clon , whereas np , om and st 91 were inactive .
however , following <unk> ( <unk> ) injection of cardiovascular depression , typical for clonidine : ( 1 ) in dogs with blocked <unk> , the drugs facilitated the <unk> meditated <unk> reflex in response to <unk> stimulation by i.v. injection of angiotensin ; ( 2 ) in dogs treated with atropine and in ( 3 ) <unk> cats ( only np , om and st 363 ) a long lasting decrease in heart rate was observed .
some of the experiments were complicated by increases in blood pressure , due to the `` leakage '' of small amounts of the highly <unk> active drugs , from the <unk> spaces into the peripheral circulation .
the majority of results indicated , that the central cardiovascular depressor effects of the tested drugs depend on their <unk> stimulating potency and on their ability to penetrate from cerebrospinal fluid or from the blood to cardiovascular centers .
relationships between the ability for penetration and the <unk> affinity are discussed .
the regulation of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase .
effects of gamma <unk> acid and <unk> .
<unk> acid ( <unk> ) in doses that increased the striatal dopamine ( da ) content of rat brain failed to increase the affinity of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ) for its <unk> cofactor or to change the sensitivity of the enzyme to the inhibition by da .
haloperidol ( 1 mg/kg ) decreased the apparent km of striatal th for the <unk> cofactor .
however , when <unk> was injected before haloperidol it prevented the decrease in the apparent kn of th , in a dose related manner .
in vitro <unk> ( 10 ( -4 ) m ) neither changed the stimulation of the striatal adenylyl cyclase by da nor its inhibition by haloperidol .
these results suggest that in striatal dopaminergic terminals the kn of th for the <unk> cofactor is regulated by an <unk> mechanism which requires that the impulse flow in the da neurons is unimpaired .
<unk> relationship xxxiii .
inhibitor of <unk> in blood serum of cancer patients .
inhibiting activity of blood serum was determined from the decrease of <unk> end groups of hyaluronic acid products released by testicular <unk> .
maximum inhibition was observed within the region of ph from 6.5 to 6.8 .
correlation between the serum concentration and its inhibiting effect on <unk> was found within the range of the final dilution of serum ( in the reaction mixture ) from 9 to 45 x .
blood sera of cancer patients showed statistically significant increase of <unk> inhibitor as compared with that of health people .
influence of peritoneal dialysis on factors affecting oxygen transport .
to determine the effect of changing concentrations of uremic metabolites on factors affecting oxygen transport , without the effects of extracorporeal blood pumping , we studied five patients before , during and after peritoneal dialysis .
significant decreases in serum urea , creatinine and phosphate and increase in serum bicarbonate were not associated with changes in p50 , a reflection of <unk> affinity .
high erythrocyte <unk> concentrations decreased only slightly .
arterial po2 increased slightly as negative fluid balance was achieved .
the slight changes in oxygen transport parameters with dialysis suggest an interplay of compensatory factors and do not warrant modifying dialysis to limit the correction on acidosis or <unk> .
effects on hemoglobin and po2 resulting from fluid loss can be the dominant influence of peritoneal dialysis on tissue oxygenation .
some effects of ammonium salts on renal histology and function in the dog .
<unk> was infused into the left renal artery of anesthetized dogs at <unk> <unk> for up to 110 min .
renal blood flow declined early then increased to <unk> levels during infusion .
kidneys perfused at 125 <unk> for 90 min showed patchy to confluent mixtures of cortical necrosis and tubular necrosis .
experimental kidneys invariably showed lower urine osmolality than contralateral controls 48 h after perfusion .
kidneys with necrosis showed depressed creatinine clearance as well .
renal artery infusion of nh4 acetate or intravenous infusion of <unk> during arterial infusion of <unk> prevented significant acidosis and caused minimal histological changes , but depression of urine osmolality was not prevented .
it is concluded that renal ammonium concentrations up to 40 <unk> for 90 min does not cause tubular necrosis but does impair urine concentration .
severe tissue damage followed renal exposure to high ammonium concentrations in the presence of metabolic or renal acidosis .
papillary necrosis associated with <unk> arteritis .
the renal papilla has a double blood supply - from both the vasa recta and the <unk> arteries .
the importance of the latter supply is not established .
a case of <unk> associated with papillary necrosis is reported , in which the <unk> vessels , supplying the area , show acute necrotizing arteritis and occlusion .
the pathophysiological and clinical implications are discussed .
fasting uric acid and phosphate in urine and plasma of renal <unk> formers .
clearance experiments in <unk> patients ( n = 60 ) and controls ( n = 60 ) demonstrated significantly higher urinary uric acid ( ua ) in younger ( less 40 years ) stone patients than controls ( median : 480 vs. 351 <unk> ) but not in older ( greater than 40 years ) patients .
serum ua and urinary <unk> were comparable in health and stone disease .
conversely urinary phosphate was significantly lower in younger patients than matched controls ( males : 224 vs. 304 mug ) and presumably is responsible for the more alkaline ph .
it is suggested that <unk> formation in humans is represented by two different populations .
effects of varying dialysate calcium concentrations on the plasma calcium fractions in patients on dialysis .
the <unk> calcium levels decreased during haemodialysis when a dialysate calcium concentration of 5 <unk> ml was used .
when dialysis was performed with a bath calcium concentration of 7.5 <unk> ml , there was a significant increase in the <unk> calcium levels in the <unk> period .
these results are discussed in relation of the optimal dialysate calcium concentrations and development of <unk> bone disease .

[ intoxication due to <unk> in 8 newborn infants ] .
identification , purification and properties of <unk> glycoprotein antigens constituting the surface coat of trypanosoma brucei .
soluble glycoproteins have been purified from a series of clones of trypanosoma brucei 427 .
each clone yielded a characteristic predominant glycoprotein which induced <unk> immunity to trypanosome infection in mice .
these glycoproteins were shown by specific labelling and enzyme digestion of cells to be the major components of the trypanosome surface coat .
each glycoprotein consisted of a single polypeptide chain having an apparent molecular weight of 65 000 ( as measured by <unk> gel electrophoresis ) and containing around 600 amino acid and 20 monosaccharide residues .
preliminary structural studies indicated large changes in amino acid sequence dispersed over a considerable length of the polypeptide chain .
proteolytic activity was demonstrated in <unk> trypanosome extracts , providing one reason for the heterogeneity sometimes observed in surface glycoprotein antigen preparations .
the determination of <unk> <unk> by reaction rate assay at 37 degrees c .
the determination of <unk> <unk> by a reaction rate assay using optimal reaction conditions at 37 degrees is described .
specific conditions and instrument settings are described for the <unk> reaction rate analyser but the actual assay conditions are applicable to any similar reaction rate system .
the precision of the method has been evaluated and a reference range for normal male ( less than 45 <unk> ) and female ( less than 30 <unk> ) subjects determined .
[ activity of some digestive enzymes in the urine and feces in infants with acute gastro-intestinal diseases ] .
the influence of cortisol on the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis in developing mammalian lung and brain .
administration of cortisol to fetal rabbits resulted in a 42 % inhibition of pulmonary de novo fatty acid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme a ( coa ) ( p = less than 0.025 ) .
this was associated with inhibition of acetyl-coa carboxylase ( <unk> <unk> ) activity ( p = less than 0.01 ) and a tendency towards decreased activity of fatty acid synthetase .
there was no effect on pulmonary microsomal fatty acid elongation activity .
light and electron microscopic examination of the apex of the right lung of control and <unk> animals revealed changes consistent with accelerated lung maturation in the treated animals .
the in vitro activities of acetyl-coa carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase were similar in rabbit lung and thus acetyl-coa carboxylase activity does not appear to be rate limiting for de novo fatty acid synthesis in lung .
no significant change in the activity of enzymes associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis of microsomal fatty acid elongation was found in fetal brain after cortisol exposure .
however , in a parallel study on fatty acid synthesis in fetal liver , cortisol administration resulted in a 30 % increase in fatty acid synthetase activity ( p less than 0.025 ) .
the finding of <unk> inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis in fetal rabbit lung may be related to the known inhibitory effect of cortisol on lung growth in the fetus .
[ tooth and alveolar process trauma in children ] .

the relation between myosin <unk> activity and inactivation of myosin under alkaline conditions of heart muscles in mammals of different size .
atpase activity of myosin in the heart muscle of the mouse , rat , <unk> , rabbit and pig was studied at neutral ph and under mild alkaline conditions .
at neutral ph the atpase activity of myosin is inversely related to body size of the animal species .
the decrease of atpase activity of myosin after alkaline <unk> depends on the degree of atpase activity of intact myosin , i.e. myosin from the heart of the mouse exhibits high atpase activity ae same relationship was found , when comparing myosin of new-born and adult heart muscle .
it is concluded that the rate of alkaline inactivation of heart myosin is directly related to the degree of atpase activity of intact myosin in all animals .
carbon dioxide response curves during hypothermia .
the responsiveness of the medullary chemoreceptors , measured by the ventilatory response to hypercapnia given in an <unk> gas mixture in intact anesthetized dogs has been evaluated during <unk> and at two levels of hypothermia .
the response was studied in : 1 ) 20 dogs during <unk> , 2 ) 10 of these dogs at a blood temperature of 32-33 degrees c , and 3 ) in the other 10 dogs during deeper hypothermia ( 28-29 degrees c ) .
the ventilatory response to co2 decreased while blood temperature was lowered until the response became absent during deep hypothermia .
for <unk> and both levels of hypothermia a similar oxygen drive of ventilation was found which was equivalent to approximately one fourth of the spontaneous ventilation .
it is suggested , that in the deeply hypothermic animal the normal respiratory drive is apparently of peripheral ( arterial ) chemoreceptor origin and when this drive is nullified or significantly decreased , gentle shivering could be responsible for stimulating the respiratory center .
[ <unk> syndrome treated medically by an inhibitor of h2 histamine receptors ] .
<unk> an histamine <unk> antagonist has been used to treat a case of <unk> syndrome characterized by a long standing diarrhea , an important gastric <unk> and a <unk> elevated plasma gastrin but without digestive ulceration .
at the dose of 600 mg per day , <unk> induced a complete suppression of acid secretion , an effect which lasted for 15 days after stopping the drug .
accordingly and since the only finding at time of laparotomy was a small lymph node enlarged with endocrine metastatic tissue , the stomach was left intact and <unk> pursued .
during the first 4 months of chronic administration of <unk> , acid secretion was maintained at levels below 25 <unk> of initial values .
<unk> however , although dosages of <unk> were increased , acid <unk> resumed and a duodenal ulcer developed .
total gastrectomy was then performed 11 months after the beginning of <unk> .
in spite of the failure of <unk> treatment , the long term follow up of this case of <unk> syndrome , allowed us to get theoretical and practical informations .

[ exercise test in the asthmatic <unk> study of 75 patients ] .
frequency of exercise-induced asthma has been studied in 75 unselected asthmatic patients ( adults and children ) by measuring the forced expiratory volume at one second ( fev1 ) and the vital capacity ( vc ) before and after a treadmill exercise , continued until heart rate was at least equal to 80 <unk> <unk> of maximum heart rate .
in 19 subjects ( 25 <unk> ) , a more than 20 <unk> decrease from control value of fev1 was recorded ten minutes after exercise ended .
exercise-induced bronchial obstruction was relieved by a beta adrenergic bronchodilator aerosol inhalation .
in the group of 19 subjects having exercise-induced asthma , a significant positive correlation was found between <unk> fev1 values and <unk> fev1 decreases .
in the whole group of 75 subjects exercise-induced asthma was related to the severity of asthma and not to other clinical or physical characteristics of the subjects .
from the data of other authors it appears that frequency of exercise-induced asthma is variable .
the reasons of those differences are discussed .

intranasal betamethasone <unk> in seasonal rhinitis .
a double-blind study comparing betamethasone <unk> and placebo aerosols was carried out in 40 patients with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and positive skin tests to grass pollens .
analysis of the symptoms recorded on a daily record card for a period of one month indicated that the mean monthly <unk> was lower for all symptoms in the group on active therapy and that this reached statistical significance for the symptom of sneezing .
significantly more antihistamine tablets were used by the placebo group as compared with the active group ( p less than <unk> ) .
the patients ' assessment of their treatment was in favour of betamethasone <unk> ( p less than <unk> ) .
no clinically significant side-effects were associated with the treatment , which was well tolerated .
urinary acidification in renal allografts .
urinary acid excretion was measured in 35 human renal allograft recipients during the first few days after the onset of diuresis and two months after transplantation .
in 16 out of 17 rejection episodes an early significant decrease of renal total net <unk> excretion was observed .
this urinary acidification impairment preceded the serum creatinine increase .
only few patients showed variations in blood ph and <unk> .
the acidification defect may be due to the ischaemic changes of rejection .
early impairment of urinary acidification supports a clinical diagnosis of rejection .
a simple test for early detection of severe renal <unk> rejection .
adding urine to a standard buffered fibrinogen solution and then coagulating it with thrombin gives reproducible coagulation times with normal <unk> .
coagulation of fibrinogen by thrombin is prolonged in acid solutions with a ph below six .
<unk> of high acidity lower the buffer ph of the fibrinogen solution below a value of six thus rendering the system <unk> or significantly prolonging the coagulation time .
with this test system we found that out of 16 severe <unk> rejections 15 were accompanied by a high acid excretion in six-hour urine specimens .
ten of these acid episodes became apparent 12 to 48 hr before clinical symptoms and before elevation of the serum creatinine could be detected .
catalysis by acetylcholinesterase : evidence that the rate-limiting step for acylation with certain substrates precedes general acid-base catalysis .
inferences about the catalytic mechanism of acetylcholinesterase ( acetylcholine hydrolase , ec <unk> ) are frequently made on the basis of a presumed analogy with chymotrypsin , ec <unk> .
although both enzymes are serine hydrolases , several differences in the steady-state kinetic properties of the two have been observed .
in this report particular attention is focused on the second-order reaction constant , <unk> .
while the reported ph dependence and deuterium oxide isotope effect associated with this parameter for chymotrypsin are generally consistent with simple models involving rate-limiting general acid-base catalysis , this study finds a more complicated situation with acetylcholinesterase .
the apparent pka of <unk> for acetylcholinesterase varies between 5.5 and 6.3 for neutral substrates and involves nonlinear inhibition by [ <unk> ] .
deuterium oxide isotope effects for <unk> range from 1.1 for acetylcholine to 1.9 for <unk> acetate .
the bimolecular reaction rate appears rate-limiting for acetylcholine at low concentrations , while a rate-limiting <unk> step is proposed to account for apparent pka values and low deuterium oxide isotope effects associated with low concentrations of phenyl acetate and <unk> acetate .
light-dependent absorption and selective scattering changes at 518 nm in chloroplast thylakoid membranes .
the <unk> absorbance change at 518 nm of isolated chloroplasts consists of a rapid phase , and a slow phase which is complete in about 20 sec .
the slow component of the 518 nm absorbance change correlates with the <unk> change in 90 degrees light scattering at 518 nm .
both show a similar time course , similar ph dependence with a maximum at ph 6.0 , and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde .
their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm .
it is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon , and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering .
it is proposed that the <unk> changes in scattering at 518 nm reflect alterations in selective dispersion , due to proton uptake and conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane .
<unk> <unk> dna synthesis in vitro : requirement for p1 ban protein in dnab mutant extracts of escherichia coli .
ammonium sulfate fractionation of crude extracts of e. coli yields a soluble enzyme fraction ( about 25-fold purification ) that catalyzes the conversion of <unk> single-stranded dna to duplex dna .
the reaction is <unk> , requires single-stranded dna , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and atp , and is stimulated by kcl .
such soluble enzyme fractions were prepared from e. coli strains carrying the prophage mutant <unk> , in which the viral dnab analog ( ban ) protein is expressed constitutively , or <unk> , in which the expression of ban protein is prevented .
<unk> activity of ban protein containing fractions from wild-type or dnab ( <unk> ) <unk> was more <unk> than that from e. coli containing only wild-type dnab protein , whereas that from dnab ( <unk> ) <unk> of dnab cells was extremely <unk> .
it is suggested that the <unk> dna synthesis with fractions from <unk> <unk> is mediated by the p1 ban protein .
intramolecular <unk> complex of carboxypeptidase a : a monitor of catalytic events .
the intensely <unk> intramolecular coordination complex formed between <unk> and the active site zinc atom of <unk> a ( johansen , j. t. & vallee , b. l. ( 1971 ) <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> usa 68 , <unk> ) is a <unk> probe of catalytic events .
the interconversion of the <unk> complex and its constituents is measured by <unk> ph and <unk> methods .
the rate of interconversion , 64,000 <unk> , is orders of magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself ( about <unk> <unk> ) .
rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the <unk> complex before hydrolysis occurs .
as a consequence , formation of <unk> , substrate binding , and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually in progress .
the results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic events , different from those postulated based on x-ray structure analysis .
if <unk> is displaced , the direction is opposite to the inward movement postulated on the basis of x-ray studies and is not unique to induction by substrates , since rapid changes in ph also result in analogous spectral changes .
<unk> carboxypeptidase has all the features which are essential for mechanistic studies : ( 1 ) it is enzymatically active ; ( 2 ) the spectra of the metal complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents ; ( 3 ) it responds dynamically to environmental factors ; and ( 4 ) the response time of the probe itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic step .
these combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render it a powerful <unk> probe to visualize and discern microscopic details of the catalytic process .
<unk> coupling of nadh dehydrogenase to active transport in membrane vesicles from escherichia coli .
addition of <unk> to e. coli ml <unk> membrane vesicles dramatically increases coupling between nadh oxidation and active transport such that initial rates and steady-state levels of lactose and amino-acid accumulation are comparable to those observed during <unk> oxidation .
similar but less dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or <unk> .
in the presence of nadh and <unk> , the vesicles also generate a membrane potential ( interior negative ) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of <unk> .
stimulation of <unk> transport by <unk> can not be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of nadh , and the effect of the quinone on <unk> lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of nadh dehydrogenase activity .
thus , it is apparent that <unk> shunts electrons from nadh dehydrogenase [ nadh : ( acceptor ) oxidoreductase ; ec <unk> ] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the <unk> site .
the findings demonstrate unequivocally that inefficient coupling of nadh oxidation to active transport can not be due to the presence of inverted vesicles .
in addition , they provide further support for specific localization of the <unk> site .
protection of lethally irradiated mice with allogeneic fetal liver cells : influence of irradiation dose on immunologic reconstitution .
after lethal irradiation long-lived , immunologically vigorous <unk> mice were produced by treatment with <unk> fetal liver cells or <unk> newborn or adult spleen cells .
treatment of lethally irradiated mice with <unk> or allogeneic newborn thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or adult spleen cells regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graft-versus-host reactions .
treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly yielded long-lived , immunologically vigorous chimeras .
the introduction of the fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development of immunological tolerance of the donor cells .
the findings suggest that t-cells at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction than are t-lymphocytes at later stages of differentiation .
these investigations turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may injure the thymic stroma , rendering it less capable of supporting certain t-cell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue .
alternatively , the higher and not the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain cell-mediated immune functions , e.g. , graft-versus-host reactions , but which is not important in others , e.g. , allograft rejections .
the higher dose of lethal irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen cells that could initiate graft-versus-host reactions but did permit the development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous allograft rejection .
these observations contribute to understanding of some of the persisting immunodeficiencies that are observed in man after fatal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation .
these results should suggest better approaches to more effective cellular engineering for correction of immunodeficiency diseases and for treatment of immunodeficiency diseases and of leukemias and malignancies of man .
mechanism of action of penicillin : triggering of the pneumococcal <unk> enzyme by inhibitors of cell wall synthesis .
during penicillin treatment of an <unk> defective mutant pneumococcus we have observed three novel phenomena : ( i ) growth of the mutant cultures is inhibited by the same concentrations of penicillin that induce lysis in the wild type .
( ii ) mutant bacteria treated with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration of penicillin will lyse upon the addition of wild-type <unk> to the growth medium .
chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of protein synthesis protect the cells against lysis by exogenous enzyme .
sensitivity of the cells to exogenous <unk> requires treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis ( e.g. , <unk> or <unk> ) since exogenous <unk> alone has no effect on bacterial growth .
( iii ) treatment with penicillin ( or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis ) causes the escape into the medium of a <unk> macromolecule that has properties suggesting that it contains pneumococcal <unk> acid ( <unk> antigen ) .
each one of these three phenomena ( growth inhibition , sensitization to exogenous <unk> , and leakage of <unk> acid ) shows the same dose response as that of the <unk> lysis of wild-type pneumococci .
on the basis of these findings we propose a new hypothesis for the mechanism of <unk> lysis of bacteria .
it is suggested that inhibition of cell wall synthesis by any means triggers bacterial <unk> enzymes by destabilizing the endogenous complex of an <unk> inhibitor ( <unk> acid ) and <unk> enzyme .
escape of <unk> <unk> material to the growth medium is a consequence of this <unk> .
chloramphenicol protects bacteria against <unk> lysis by interfering with the activity of the <unk> enzyme , rather than by depleting the concentration of the enzyme at the cell surface .
identification of <unk> reductase system in euglena <unk> .
euglena gracilis contains a protein system which can utilize the reducing power of nadph in the ribonucleotide <unk> reduction of ctp .
the proteins required for this reaction are a <unk> with a molecular weight of approximately 185,000 which is functionally similar to thioredoxin reductase ( nadph ) , ec <unk> , and another protein ( protein i ) whose function in the reaction is unknown .
this new protein does not appear to contain a prosthetic group and has a molecular weight of approximately 240,000 .
in addition , the ribonucleotide reductase active in the euglena <unk> reductase system is more complex than the protein reported in a previous publication [ ( 1974 ) j. <unk> <unk> 249 , <unk> ] .
the enzyme preparation described in this report contains four different types of polypeptide chains which may complex to form the active enzyme .
purification of folate binding factor in normal umbilical cord serum .
human umbilical cord serum was found to contain both free folate and folate complexed to a <unk> weight factor .
the complexed folate was bound to a very high affinity binder and was present in concentrations equivalent to as much as 60 ng of <unk> acid per ml of serum .
acidification of the serum caused disassociation of the <unk> complex .
released <unk> were separated from binder by <unk> gel filtration , zonal centrifugation through sucrose gradients , or adsorption onto activated charcoal .
the separated binding factor , either saturated or unsaturated with folate , had a molecular weight of about 40,000 on <unk> <unk> chromatography .
binding of [ 3h ] <unk> acid was rapid and , as in the original endogenous <unk> complex , was essentially irreversible at neutral ph .
the affinity and specificity of the binder were examined by competition experiments using [ 3h ] <unk> acid and nonradioactive folate derivatives .
oxidized <unk> were bound in preference to reduced derivatives , but only three to four times more unlabeled <unk> acid than <unk> acid was required to produce an equal level of competition .
the strong affinity for <unk> acid , the main serum folate , suggests that the binder could be part of the mechanism by which the fetus concentrates maternally supplied folate for its growth and development .
intramolecular <unk> complex of carboxypeptidase a : a monitor of multiple conformational states in solution .
the red <unk> complex of <unk> , previously used to demonstrate differences in conformation of the enzyme in crystals and in solution , has now provided means to detect multiple conformations of the enzyme in solution by <unk> ph and temperature jump experiments .
these studies identify two distinct processes .
er + <unk> in equilibrium ey ( i ) , is the extremely rapid , <unk> about 10 ( 5 ) <unk> , ph dependent dissociation of the metal complex .
ey in equilibrium ey ' ( ii ) , is much slower , <unk> about 5 <unk> , ph independent interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules , ey and ey ' , in which the yellow <unk> is different conformations .
these two conformations can be differentiated readily by <unk> <unk> experiments , since i is three to four orders of magnitude faster than ii .
mathematical expressions derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the ph range from 6.0 to 8.5 .
in a previous <unk> <unk> experiment , <unk> and coworkers [ <unk> , f. a. , mcmurray , c. h. & <unk> , w. h. ( 1972 ) , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> usa 69 , <unk> ] recognized only a single process with a rate constant of about 6 <unk> , but not the major , very rapid rate observed here .
the failure to detect this fast process led to the postulation of a number of explanations intended to account for the detection of only a single , slow rate .
the present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not valid .
the <unk> reveals the existence of rapidly <unk> substructures of carboxypeptidase a , and the results support the view that in solution , enzymes can adopt multiple , readily <unk> and related conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis .
in crystals , rearrangement of molecular structure could be severely impaired or restricted , and crystallization might single out either active or inactive conformations .
in the latter case , such crystals would have greatly reduced activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior , as is observed for carboxypeptidase a .
in combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals , conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme mechanisms and select crystals for x-ray structure analysis .
presence of norepinephrine and related enzymes in isolated brain <unk> .
norepinephrine and the enzymes involved in its synthesis and degradation were found to be associated with isolated brain <unk> .

disorders of <unk> in bacterial prostatitis .
measurements of urinary flow rate were performed in 16 patients with established prostatitis before and after a course of antimicrobial therapy .
before treatment the maximum flow rates were poor with abnormal flow curves and significant improvement in voiding characteristics were observed with treatment ( p less than 0.01 ) .
a preliminary electrophysiological ( emg ) study of sphincter activity suggested that the obstruction to the flow of urine was at least in part due to failure of the external sphincter to relax during <unk> .
although the total number of cases in this series was small the study showed that prostatitis was associated with a disorder of <unk> which correlated with the other clinical features of the disease and could be objectively evaluated .

from the analysis of titration curves with hydrogen and 5-ht ions , it was found that the electrostatic interaction parameter of protein <unk> and the number sites of 5-ht fixing were smaller over an acid and base ph range as compared to their values at neutral ph .
our data were interpreted by the conformational changes which can be induced when bsa is exposed to denaturation by acid and alkali ph .
[ circadian variations of the activity and induction of tyrosine aminotransferase after <unk> ] .
some <unk> properties of mitochondrial and cell sap alanine aminotransferase from the rat cns .
the authors describe different properties of brain mitochondrial and cell sap alanine aminotransferase .
they showed that the mitochondrial enzyme was inhibited by maleate , chlorides , acetate and phosphate with a high ionic strength ( over 1.8 ) , that its ph optimum lay between 7.5 and 8.5 , that it was <unk> at over 40 degrees c and that it was salted out from solutions with ammonium sulphate at 0.6 -- 0.8 saturation .
the activity of the cell sap enzyme was inhibited by phosphate at an ionic strength of only 0.12 , less markedly by maleate and not at all by chlorides and acetate ; its ph optimum was about 8 , it was <unk> up to 60 degrees c and was precipitated from ammonium sulphate solution at between 0.35 and 0.6 saturation .
the authors conclude from their results that two different alanine aminotransferase enzymes are present in the cns .

the effect of l-dopa on young patients with simple schizophrenia , treated with neuroleptic drugs : a double-blind cross-over trial with <unk> and placebo .
thirteen out of 18 young out-patients with simple schizophrenia under neuroleptic treatment completed a double-blind cross-over trial with <unk> [ l-dopa + <unk> ( a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor ) ] and placebo .
nine patients were given 900 mg l-dopa + 225 mg <unk> daily , 1 patient received 600 mg l-dopa + 150 mg <unk> , and 3 patients , 300 mg l-dopa + 75 mg <unk> .
in these doses , l-dopa was effective against emotional withdrawal , blunted affect , tendency to isolation and apathy , without inducing or aggravating productive , accessory symptoms .
the activity score , according to the specific <unk> scale , was significantly increased ( p less than 0.05 ) , whereas the total <unk> score ( brief psychiatric rating scale ) was slightly , but significantly reduced ( p less than 0.05 ) .
in cases where l-dopa had to be limited to 600 and 300 mg daily , a tendency to anxiety , distortion of thinking , and a sense of unreality were observed , depending on the dose of l-dopa .
in no case were gastrointestinal , cardiovascular or neurological side-effects observed .
the specificity of binding of the narcotic agonist <unk> in synaptic membranes of rat brain in vivo .
when <unk> was administered to rats in a pharmacologically effective dose ( 0.75 <unk> <unk> ) , the labeled drug was concentrated in synaptic membrane fractions isolated from the brains of rats killed 10 min after <unk> injection .
pretreatment of the animals with the narcotic antagonists naloxone , <unk> or <unk> , blocked the pharmacological responses to <unk> and reduced <unk> binding in the membrane fractions .
the differences between <unk> bound in synaptic membranes of rats treated with <unk> ( inactive isomer ) and <unk> ( active antagonist ) were in the same range as the reductions in <unk> binding in <unk> rats , indicating that stereospecific and <unk> binding sites in synaptic membranes in vivo were of the same magnitude : about 0.04 <unk> brain .
the cholinergic system and nociception in the primate : interactions with morphine .
in experiment 1 the shock titration task was used to evaluate the <unk> properties of 5 different classes of cholinergic compounds in the rhesus monkey .
only scopolamine and high doses of physostigmine were effective in elevating the shock threshold .
the apparent <unk> effect of physostigmine , however , was difficult to separate from its nonspecific behavioral depressant effect and was probably not related to an increase in cholinergic tone .
experiment 2 examined the interaction of morphine with <unk> , scopolamine and physostigmine .
only scopolamine ( 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg ) and high doses of physostigmine ( 0.1 mg/kg ) interacted with morphine in the shock titration paradigm .
the multiplicative interaction of morphine with scopolamine was confirmed in experiment 3 over a wider range of doses .
it was concluded that morphine and the cholinergic compounds produce <unk> effects through different mechanisms of the pain system .
effects of <unk> derivatives on human sleep as compared to those of benzodiazepine derivatives .
the effects of new <unk> derivatives , such as <unk> and <unk> , on normal human sleep were investigated on 5 subjects and compared to those of benzodiazepine derivatives , such as diazepam and nitrazepam .
rem sleep was significantly decreased only with 2 mg of <unk> and rebound elevation of rem sleep did not follow in recovery 1 and 2 nights .
by using partial differential rem deprivation which was designed by us , there was also no rebound elevation of rem sleep noted in recovery 2 nights following 2 mg of <unk> medication .
rem sleep was not suppressed with 15 mg of <unk> , 6 mg of diazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam when compared to the baseline night .
with regard to nrem sleep , stage 2 was significantly increased with 15 mg of <unk> and 10 mg of nitrazepam , but stage sws was significantly decreased with 10 mg of nitrazepam .
effect of two weeks ' treatment with <unk> , chlorpromazine , <unk> and <unk> , alone or in combination with alcohol , on learning and memory in man .
forty paid healthy male students participated in two subacute experiments of 6 weeks each .
in the first trial 20 of them received <unk> , <unk> , and placebo double blind cross over for 2 weeks each , and in the second trial the active agents administered to the other 20 participants were chlorpromazine and <unk> .
the tests used were paired associate learning with nonsense syllables and digit memory span .
before testing the subjects took either an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic bitter drink .
as in the previous study from this laboratory , alcohol was found to impair learning capacity .
of the drugs used only <unk> impaired learning significantly , and the combined effect of alcohol and <unk> on learning capacity was very deleterious .
the <unk> effect of drugs did not correlate with their effect on learning .
caution is necessary when prescribing <unk> for active outpatients at least in doses used in this study .
effects of chronic exposure to stressors on <unk> behavior and on brain norepinephrine .
a single exposure to a severe stressor ( either cold swim or inescapable shock ) impairs subsequent performance in a shuttle <unk> task ( 1 ) , a deficit attributed to reduction in brain noradrenergic activity produced by these stressors .
in the present paper , two experiments are described which examine how repeated exposure to such stressors affects ( a ) shuttle <unk> performance ( experiment 1 ) , and ( b ) aspects of brain norepinephrine metabolism ( experiment 2 ) .
experiment 1 showed that , whereas subjects receiving the single exposure to cold swim or shock showed a large <unk> deficit , subjects that received repeated exposure to these stressors for 14 days performed similarly to the control group that received no stressor .
experiment 2 showed that , whereas subjects that received one session of the inescapable shock stressor showed a lower level of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and cortex than did subjects that received no shock , subjects that received repeated exposure to inescapable shock or cold swim showed neurochemical `` habituation . ''
subjects that received repeated shock showed elevated tyrosine hydroxylase activity and no depletion of norepinephrine level , and both repeated shock and cold swim caused a decrease in uptake of <unk> by slices of cortex in vitro .
thus , it is concluded that the behavioral and neurochemical changes that were observed after the stressful conditions studied are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in <unk> responding following exposure to these stressful events are due to changes in brain noradrenergic activity .

results show that a considerable amount of improvement can not be ascribed to the two critical factors or the interaction of both , but are due to unspecific influences in the course of treatment .
some of the results concerning the combination of th and the psychotropic drug pose interesting questions for further research and bare implications for double-blind trials of psychotropic drugs .
the results suggest that possibly properties of any psychotropic drug have to be related to a doctor-patient relationship within which the personal problems of the patient are dealt with .
in order to evaluate such properties , special methodological precautions have to be taken .
these will be briefly discussed .

role of cardiovascular and ionic changes in pathogenesis and prevention of <unk> cardiac necrosis .
blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen uptake , and blood values of po2 , pco2 , and ph were studied in <unk> rats for 8 hours .
after a <unk> dose of 20 mg/kg <unk> , s.c. , blood pressure fell from 117 to 72 mm hg , heart rate accelerated from 326 to 497 <unk> , and cardiac work diminished by about 15 % .
metabolic rate increased by about 80 % , blood values of po2 rose , and those of pco2 fell somewhat , whereas blood ph dropped from 7.48 to 7.38 , indicating metabolic acidosis .
propranolol ( 40 mg/kg , i.p. ) and verapamil ( 50 mg/kg , i.p. ) , both of which almost completely prevented <unk> cardiac <unk> , inhibited the <unk> and <unk> actions of <unk> by about 50 % .
while propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of <unk> completely , verapamil enhanced it : blood pressure fell to 46 mm hg .
<unk> fall of blood ph was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil .
decrease of blood ph and <unk> were enhanced when <unk> was given together with 4.8 g/kg ethanol , p.o .
in conclusion , hemodynamic actions of <unk> , especially hypotension , seem to be nonessential for the production of cardiac <unk> .
strong acidification can aggravate the cardiotoxicity of <unk> .
alterations in norepinephrine pattern in the damaged myocardium in the rat .
in the albino rat , the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single injection of iso was accompanied by a fall in total ne .
pretreatment with propranolol and <unk> protected against <unk> necrosis and myocardial hypertrophy , but did not influence the <unk> depletion of ne stores .
the depletion of ne stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased <unk> metabolism of ne since , in <unk> rats , neither cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor mao activity was altered .
the decrease in endogenous ne is not due to a defect in the storage of ne .
the ability of myocardium to take up and store ne returned to normal within 48 hours , whereas endogenous levels returned to normal within 5 days , even in the presence of demonstrable necrosis .
thus , there is lack of correlation between chemical and morphological changes , since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of morphologically demonstrable tissue injury , and the function of the adrenergic neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis .
prevention of myocardial ca overload and <unk> by mg and k salts or acidosis .
the crucial point in the pathogenesis of <unk> myocardial <unk> is an abundant intracellular ca accumulation leading to high energy phosphate exhaustion .
accordingly , in the early stage of the <unk> <unk> process , the onset of atp and creatine phosphate breakdown strictly parallels the acute ca gain .
in this type of necrosis , the mg losses from the myocardium appear as a concomitant phenomenon .
the hearts can be protected against the deleterious ca overload and <unk> by increasing the plasma concentration of mg , k , or h ions in order to counterbalance ca according to the ration ( see article ) .
on the other hand , if mg , k , or h ion concentrations are too low , <unk> ca uptake and myocardial lesions are potentiated .
receptors for insulin , <unk> , and growth hormone : applications to disease states in man .
explanation of the stimulation of microsomal <unk> reactions by soluble supernatant fraction .
addition of the cell soluble supernatant fraction to an assay medium containing nadph generating system , mixed function oxidase substrate and <unk> , resulted in a stimulation of drug metabolism ranging from <unk> % .
this stimulation was observed only when the supply of <unk> generating system ( <unk> dehydrogenase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase ) was insufficient , leading to a nadph oxidation rate which was greater than the rate of reduction of <unk> during the oxidation of a drug .
hence , under our assay conditions , the soluble <unk> ( ss ) is only providing sufficient nadph generator , and possibly relieving inhibition by the generated <unk> .
finally , microsomal lipid peroxidation measurements under these same conditions indicate negligible to no peroxidation activity in the absence of ss .
an attempt to correlated analgesia to changes in brain <unk> in rats .
the analgesic activity of <unk> , morphine and sodium salicylate was studied concomitantly with changes in brain stem levels of <unk> , <unk> , da and na .
the results show that a correlation exists between analgesia and changes in the serotonergic system of the brain stem .
furthermore morphine sulfate was found to increase the da concentration of the brain stem while <unk> increased na levels .
we conclude that serotonergic system may be of major importance in analgesia while simultaneous changes in this system and/or the da and na systems may lead to a more pronounced analgesic activity .
colorimetric determination of <unk> acid and its <unk> metabolite on urine and feces .
a simple and convenient colorimetric method is described for the quantitative determination of <unk> acid ( <unk> ) and <unk> in urine and feces after oral administration of <unk> ( sasp ) , the drug of choice in the treatment of ulcerative colitis .
<unk> is extracted directly from the acidified biological specimen , <unk> , and the liberated <unk> subjected to a modified <unk> reaction .
the <unk> present in the specimen must be acetylated with acetic anhydride prior to extraction .
the violet colored product of the <unk> reaction has a <unk> of 560 nm and conforms to <unk> law over the concentration range of <unk> <unk> .
average recoveries ( <unk> s.d. , n = 6 ) of <unk> added to rat and human urine and rat fecal <unk> were 91.6 <unk> 4.9 % , 102 <unk> 6.0 % , and 71.0 <unk> 4.8 % , respectively .
interference by sasp and its <unk> <unk> is negligible .
as demonstrated , the colorimetric method is of sufficient sensitivity for application in most metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies conducted with sasp in laboratory animals and man .
[ pressures , blood gases , ph , lactate and pyruvate concentrations in the portal venous blood in patients after laparotomy during the first 9 days ( <unk> transl ) ] .
in 24 patients ( 16 women , 8 men , mean age 60 years ) , who underwent abdominal operations and who had a uncomplicated postoperative course , a <unk> was inserted into the portal vein at the end of laparotomy and remained there for maximal 9 days .
the mean values of the portal venous pressure as well as of the <unk> venous pressure gradient are unchanged during the period of all 9 days and are between <unk> and <unk> mmhg , between 5,6 and <unk> mmhg respectively .
the <unk> venous 0 ( 2 ) <unk> difference shows in the mean no fluctuations and is about 2 vol. % .
on the first postoperative day the lactic and pyruvic acid concentrations in the artery and portal vein are moderately , but significantly elevated and decrease to normal values until day 7 .

biochemical and biophysical changes in guinea pigs after acute head injury .
animal experiments were set up mainly to derive additional diagnostic data from the study of biochemical changes after acute head injury .
in standardized experiments guinea pigs were subjected in groups of 20 to three identical head injuries , each of either 1.0 j or 1.5 j intensity .
the trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man ; 40 animals served as controls .
during the 60 min after injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a <unk> condition or <unk> in the traumatized animals compared with control animals .
superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings .
temperature and respiration were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries .
blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 j injury but even though <unk> was not present <unk> values and p50 increased , compared with the control animals .
the fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor ( 1.0 j ) trauma .
of special significance was the increased activity of malate dehydrogenase and aldolase , found only in the blood of severely traumatized animals , as this could serve as an early diagnostic aid for evaluating head injuries .
total brain ischaemia in dogs : cerebral physiological and metabolic changes after 15 minutes of circulatory arrest .
<unk> of the ascending aorta in dogs for 15 min produced severe neurological deficit , observed for up to 20 h .
immediately after restoration of the circulation , the intracranial pressure in the cisterna magna increased transiently to a mean peak of 22.8 torr ( sd <unk> 1.7 ) because of a compensatory increase in systemic arterial pressure , without a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure .
the intracranial pressure returned to control values 15-30 min after ischaemia and showed no secondary rise during the 8 h of observation .
the electroencephalogram became isoelectric 34 <unk> 6.5 s ( mean <unk> ) after circulatory occlusion , and was abnormal when it reappeared 5 h 36 min ( sd <unk> 2 h 4 min ) after the circulation was restored .
the electrical impedance of the brain increased immediately after ischaemia and returned rapidly towards <unk> values during <unk> .
the cerebral water had not increased measurably 4 h after ischaemia .
after ischaemia , the lactate concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid increased to 4.7 <unk> ( sem <unk> ) and the ph decreased to 7.17 ( sem <unk> ) ; both returned to control values after 3.5 h .
the cerebral glucose uptake was decreased 35 min after ischaemia , cerebral oxygen uptake remained unchanged but cerebral blood flow decreased ( p less than 0.05 at 90 min ) .
immediately after cardiac arrest , recovery was impaired more by the presence of focal abnormal brain perfusion than by intracranial hypertension .
oxygen and carbon dioxide dissociation of duck blood .
oxygen and co2 dissociation of duck blood was studied in blood samples equilibrated with known gas mixtures at the <unk> body temperature ( 41 degrees c ) and analyzed in the van slyke <unk> apparatus and in ph electrodes .
at various ph values between 7.38 and 7.55 the hill plots yielded straight and parallel lines over a wide range of o2 saturation , the hill coefficient being 2.9 .
half saturation pressure p50 at ph = 7.50 was 36 torr .
the bohr effect factor was <unk> .
buffering properties were analyzed by <unk> blood samples with gas mixtures of different pco2 at 41 degrees c .
the buffer value for whole blood in the range of 3-7 % co2 was 19.3 <unk> , the buffer value for true plasma 22.9 <unk> .
the co2 dissociation curve constructed using the buffer values had a slope of 0.17 <unk> in the pco2 range from 40 to 50 torr .
the co2 content of oxygenated blood at pco2 = 40 torr was 21.7 <unk> .
the haldane effect factor at pco2 = 35 torr equalled 0.30 mmol of combined co2 per mmol hbo2 .
with the values of po2 , pco2 and ph measured in arterial blood of undisturbed and unrestrained , resting ducks effective dissociation curves for both o2 and co2 were constructed assuming a metabolic <unk> of 0.8 .
these curves are expected to resemble closely the actual in vitro dissociation curves of resting ducks .
first apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid , <unk> , of plasma and erythrocytes .
the first apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid , <unk> , of plasma and red cells was determined on venous blood of ten healthy , adult , male , human subjects .
ph and pco2 of plasma and red cells were analyzed <unk> and a <unk> method was used for the determination of total carbon dioxide content .
erythrocyte <unk> hemoglobin levels were estimated and used for the correction of erythrocyte <unk> .
each blood sample was subjected to the following regimen before centrifugation , 1 ) as drawn from the <unk> vein , 2 ) oxygenated with a 5 % co2 , o2 balance gas mixture , and 3 ) reduced with a 5 % co2 , n2 balance gas mixture .
<unk> of plasma and red cells are presented : ( see article ) .
the consistently larger values for red cell <unk> than the respective plasma data may be attributed to the greater amount of <unk> hemoglobin concentration present in the erythrocytes .
a simplified method for the calculation of erythrocyte bicarbonate concentration using the experimentally determined red cell <unk> value has been formulated .
the method involves the use of a regression equation relating plasma and red cell ph , the equivalence of plasma and red cell pco2 , along with the experimentally determined red cell <unk> .
the effects of changes in ph and pco2 in blood and water on breathing in rainbow trout , salmo <unk> .
the effect of sustained hypercapnia on the acid-base balance and gill ventilation in rainbow trout , salmo <unk> , was studied .
the response to an increase in <unk> from 0.3 to 5.2 mm hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume and a slight increase in breathing frequency .
there was a concomitant rise in <unk> and an immediate fall in pha .
if <unk> was maintained at 5.2 mm hg for several days , ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial , <unk> level within three days .
arterial ph also returned to the initial level within 2-3 days .
these results are consistent with the hypothesis that under these conditions fish regulate ph via <unk> exchange across the gills rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of <unk> .
a reduction in environmental ph causes a reduction in pha but only a slow gradual increase in vg .
injections of <unk> or <unk> into the blood have opposite effects on pha but both cause a marked increase in vg .
it is concluded that a rise in <unk> results in a rise in vg and that changes in ph in blood or water have little direct effect on vg in rainbow trout .
possible location for receptors involved in this reflex response are discussed .

the effect of ph upon fluoride uptake in intact enamel .
the relationship between ph and fluoride uptake in intact enamel of permanent premolars was investigated by using : ( 1 ) a sodium fluoride <unk> , ( 2 ) a potassium fluoride + manganese chloride <unk> , and ( 3 ) a sodium fluoride solution of the same fluoride concentration .
the first part of this paper deals with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from <unk> slurries and from sodium fluoride solutions of different ph ranging from 7.1 to 4.5 .
this investigation showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the effect of the ph was significant .
the uptake of fluoride in the form of <unk> was more than five times larger at the lower ph level .
the second part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake ( increase in fluoride content ) from <unk> in the same ph range .
it was shown that the three agents gave the same initial rate of fluoride uptake ( about 50 <unk> ( 6 ) <unk> ) at ph 6 and that the rate of fluoride uptake in the outer layer of the enamel was proportional to the hydrogen ion activity .
determination of inorganic pyrophosphatase in rat <unk> layer by a radiochemical method .
the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase ( <unk> , ec <unk> ) from the <unk> layer of rat incisors has been studied by means of a radiochemical <unk> .
the enzyme was incubated with <unk> in <unk> buffer at 37 degrees c .
the reaction was linear with time for at least 45 min , and the ph optimum was found to be 8.8 , independent of the amount of pyrophosphate present .
heating the enzyme at 56 degrees c inhibited the enzyme activity rapidly , <unk> ions activated the enzyme by 15 % at an ion concentration of 4 mm , while higher concentrations were inhibitory .
<unk> ions and <unk> inhibited the enzyme at all concentrations .
<unk> ions did not affect the <unk> at concentrations below 8 mm , whereas higher concentrations had an inhibiting effect .
urea was found to inhibit the enzyme at concentrations above 1.5 m , while edta was a strong inhibitor at very low concentrations .
the characteristics of <unk> agree well with the properties of the enzyme nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( ec <unk> ) studied earlier .
assessment of denture plaque ph in subjects with and without denture stomatitis .
to evaluate the `` resting '' ph and induced ph changes in denture plaque , soft deposits were collected from the fitting surface of the denture , pooled and suspended in water .
plaque ph was determined with microelectrode equipment before and after mouth rinsing with a sucrose solution .
a characteristic level in the `` resting '' ph of denture plaque was found in most of 12 subjects tested .
ph values below the baseline level were recorded for more than 2 h after a rinse .
the ph depressions were more pronounced in maxillary than in mandibular plaque .
further , the ph minima tended to be lower in subjects with denture stomatitis than in controls .
no clear relationship could be established between the `` resting '' ph and the concentration of candida hyphae in denture smears or palatal inflammation .
bioluminescence assay of enzymes obtained from buccal epithelium by superficial scraping .
a method is presented for the simultaneous assay of buccal enzymes by measuring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate with the aid of the bioluminescence of luciferase extracts .
the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( <unk> ) was shown earlier to be increased in homogeneous <unk> of the oral mucosa .
since smoking has been implicated as an etiologic factor of leukoplakia , <unk> was measured in the normal buccal epithelium of cigarette smokers .
no difference was found in the activity of <unk> between smokers and nonsmokers when related to the activity of pyruvate kinase , which is known to be invariable in healthy and <unk> oral mucosa .

gastric emptying of liquids after different <unk> and <unk> .
gastric emptying of five liquid meals which differ in their physicochemical properties have been measured in control dogs and dogs that have received a <unk> <unk> alone , proximal gastric <unk> without drainage , selective gastric <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
the first two phases of emptying have been computed by the method of least squares to obtain a <unk> pattern and are expressed as relative rates : the initial <unk> process is characterized by beta or the average relative rate of emptying in the first ten minutes , the basic or exponential rate as beta and the change in rate from the initial to basic pattern as <unk> .
each measure of gastric emptying was statistically analyzed to determine specific differences in rates between the operations studied .
we confirmed the earlier claims that <unk> alone does not change the emptying rate of liquid meals .
each measure or phase of emptying varies consistently across the operations from meal to meal tested .
initial emptying after all three <unk> is significantly faster than control with progressive rate increases as proximal gastric <unk> is compared with selective gastric <unk> with <unk> and with <unk> <unk> with <unk> , probably indicative of gastric <unk> loss of accommodation to volume distention after denervation .
the basic exponential pattern of emptying is not lost after any of the operations studied .
the basic rate after proximal gastric <unk> and selective gastric <unk> with <unk> is nearly identical , slightly delayed from the control rate and significantly slower than the more rapid rate after <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
possible explanations for these are discussed and imply a particular importance of the hepatic and celiac vagal fibers , sectioned only with <unk> <unk> , in the regulation of gastric emptying of liquids .
pancreatic enzyme response with an elemental diet .
elemental diets can maintain or slightly improve the nutritional status without a major stimulatory effect on the pancreas .
six dogs were maintained with a regular chow diet , switched to an elemental diet and , subsequently , returned to a chow diet .
<unk> of the pancreatic duct through a duodenal cutaneous fistula revealed the enzyme response to be decreased in a dog maintained with an elemental diet , with no or only a slight weight gain .
return to a regular diet resulted in a return of pancreatic enzyme response .

gastric fibrinolysis .
gastric juice from 15 normals , 20 patients with gastric ulcer and 14 patients with erosive haemorrhagic <unk> was investigated in respect of its activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates and its content of fdp and plasminogen or plasmin with <unk> methods .
gastric juice from normals showed no activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates , and no fdp or plasminogen could be demonstrated .
in the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric juice showed little or no <unk> activity on fibrin plates except in 2 , who had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral ph of the juice .
these patients had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be demonstrated .
it was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis , but to non-specific proteolytic activity ( probably trypsin ) .
the patients with erosive haemorrhage <unk> exhibited quite a different picture .
the gastric juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates , the activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates .
the activity was inhibited in vitro by addition of <unk> and in vivo after administration of amca .
the occurence of <unk> could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the gastric juice .
by <unk> of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin .
the patients with erosive haemorrhagic <unk> showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood , but low values for plasminogen and <unk> , and the serum contained fdp .
these findings in the blood and gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and duodenum .
there is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes substantially to the bleeding tendency .
the effect of administration of amca on <unk> activity and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such a mechanism .

acid-base parameters in the dehydrated camel .
the effect of prolonged ( 10 days ) dehydration on acid-base parameters of camel blood was examined .
the ph and pco2 levels rose significantly in the course of dehydration .
this state was comparable with compensated <unk> alkalosis found in other animals .
the plasma sodium , and magnesium levels rose significantly also .
the plasma oxygen and calcium levels declined significantly .
there were no significant changes in potassium and phosphate levels .
it is concluded that the changes found in acid-base status following dehydration are further evidence of water preservation mechanisms in the dehydrated camel .

the effect of a simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage on cerebral blood flow in the monkey .
the hydrogen clearance method was used to measure local and total cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) in the rhesus monkey before and for five hours after a simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) .
cbf remained stable after sah unless sah was associated with a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure .
in addition , cerebrovascular resistance did not increase after sah .
these results suggest that vasoactive agents in fresh whole blood , and the arterial spasm they produce when added to cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) , play only a limited role in the pathogenesis of ischemic encephalopathy that follows an sah .
effects of oxygen saturation and pco2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues in rabbits .
the effect of oxygen saturation and pco2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues was studied in rabbits .
using a modified oldendorf technique , <unk> glucose analogues with a <unk> reference standard were introduced into the cerebral circulation via the common carotid artery , and the radioactivity of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a brain uptake index ( bui ) .
severe hypoxia ( oxygen saturation less than or equal to 18 % ) resulted in approximately a 40 % decrease in the bui of <unk> and a 45 % decrease in the bui of <unk> .
severe hypercapnia ( pco2 = 100 mm hg ) caused a 45 % decrease in the bui of both of these glucose analogues .
hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect .
<unk> ( pco2 = 15 mm hg ) increased the bui of <unk> by 35 % of the control value , and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition .
when bui values were plotted against ph rather than pco2 for the same experiments , there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression .
these results are compared with previous findings on pathologically induced changes in brain uptake of glucose analogues , and the possible role of blood flow is considered in detail .
lactate and pyruvate concentrations , and acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid in experimentally induced intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage in dogs .
the effect of blood injected into either subarachnoid space or subcortical brain tissue upon lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) was studied in the anesthetized dog .
csf lactate and <unk> ratio ( <unk> ratio ) increased progressively following the intracranial injection of blood and reached the maximum level at six hours after injection .
these changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) .
an increase in csf lactate and <unk> ratio in hemorrhagic csf seems to be caused by two different factors .
shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate , and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow .
therefore , an increase in csf lactate with a concomitant rise in csf <unk> ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia , even when csf is hemorrhagic .
the association of an increase in csf lactate to a disproportionate decrease in csf <unk> was also observed in these animals .
a study of variables affecting the quality of platelets stored at `` room temperature '' .
the effect of variables associated with the donor and with methods of collecting , processing , and storing platelets on the quality of platelets kept at ambient temperature was studied .
changes in structural integrity of platelets , decrease in ph , loss of <unk> , and kinetics in vivo of platelets tagged with <unk> were used as indicators of the tolerance of platelets to storage .
a platelet concentration of less than 2.5 x 10 ( 6 ) per cu mm , a temperature of storage less than 24 c , and continuous , gentle , agitation were found to be essential for satisfactory preservation of platelet integrity , function , and <unk> survival .
platelets from female donors tolerated storage less well than did platelets from male donors , possibly because the lower hematocrit of blood collection from females resulted in greater initial acidity of the concentrate .
a number of other variables analyzed appear to be of little or no consequence for successful platelet storage .

<unk> neurons of the substantia nigra and their terminals in the <unk> .
tne ultrastructural and fluorescence <unk> characteristics of the mature rabbit substantia nigra and <unk> have been reviewed as a frame of reference for the developmental study .
biochemical investigations were reported on <unk> dopamine concentrations and the relative uptake and accumulation of <unk> by this tissue from fetal to adult stages , to provide quantitative data for correlation with the <unk> information .
the development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the <unk> has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life .
the initial bipolar neuroblasts , which develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon , are fluorescent as soon as they emerge from the <unk> zone .
their fluorescent axons , which form the <unk> pathway , reach the telencephalon at day 16 of gestation and <unk> extensively in the putamen by day 20 , but do not enter the caudate nucleus until several days later .
some of the early fluorescent axonal profiles in the putamen are extremely large .
electron microscopic study of theis stage suggests that the large fluorescent profiles may correspond to axonal growth cones or early synapses .
a distinct substantia nigra , pars compacta and reticulata , can be recognized by fluorescence microscopy by day 20 of gestation .
electron microscopy reveals that the young neurons are multipolar with numerous developing dendrites , some of which exhibit early synaptic junctions .
the subsequent <unk> of these cells and the neuropil is described .
the fluorescent axons of the substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner forming fluorescent islands throughout the <unk> in late fetal life .
occasionally , minute beaded fluorescent axons are found .
these profiles might correspond to some of the axons with <unk> `` en passage '' revealed by electron microscopy .
in an attempt to identify further the <unk> axon , the <unk> of adult <unk> incubated in <unk> was reported .
axonal <unk> `` en passage '' containing a dense `` tag '' in the vesicles were found .
most of the tagged <unk> did not exhibit synaptic contacts .
the possible significance of these finding s as related to dopamine secretion are discussed .

[ separation of the hormones of the <unk> of rats by use of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate ] .
a comparative study of rat <unk> extract and its alcohol fractions was performed by two variants of the method of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel : at ph <unk> and with the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate at ph 7.2 .
with the presence of sodium <unk> four protein zones are found which in the order from the anode towards the cathode are identified as hemoglobin , somatotropin , <unk> and albumin .
it is shown that the somatotropin zone after the extract separation at ph 9.5 is inhomogeneous and consists of somatotropin and hemoglobin .
[ properties of <unk> of the nuclei of the liver cells of rats ] .

it is established that its highest activity is at 37 degrees with activation energy equal to <unk> <unk> and with factor q10 equal to 1.5 .
the enzyme ph optimum in 0.2 m tris acetate is equal to 6.5 and in 0.2 potassium phosphate - 7.5 .

[ properties of glutamine synthetase of the brain of rats during <unk> ] .
when investigating activity of glutamine synthetase of the enzymatic preparations isolated from the brain of rats of 0.5 , 1 , 3 , 12 and 24-month age , no considerable differences were found in the indices of the values km to <unk> and vmax which are respectively equal to : km ( m-10 ( -3 ) ) <unk> ; 3.5 ; 3.6 ; 3.9 ; 5.5 ; <unk> ; 4.5 ; 5.0 ; 5.2 mum were found .

enzyme activation energy , inactivation energy and enthalpy were calculated ; apparent km values of <unk> with respect to <unk> and atp are equal to <unk> ( -7 ) m and <unk> ( -7 ) m , respectively .
[ biosynthesis of <unk> and its regulation in the yeast pichia <unk> ] .
the nature of riboflavin precursors was studied in the yeast pichia <unk> .
by means of mutants with blocked <unk> the purine precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to <unk> compounds .
accumulation of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> occurs in the <unk> mutants divided into five biochemical groups .
this fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast p. <unk> and saccharomyces cerevisiae .
synthesis of <unk> by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked <unk> synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin ; <unk> in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process .
consequently , <unk> in p. <unk> is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means of <unk> mechanism .
a change in the content of <unk> in the cells has no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase ; at the same time iron deficiency in the cells evokes <unk> of this enzyme .
incubation of the cells rich in iron with <unk> or alpha , <unk> also causes <unk> of riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by <unk> .
a deficiency of hem in the mutants which need <unk> acid does not affect the <unk> activity of the cells .
evidently , in p. <unk> a certain form of <unk> iron might take part in regulating synthesis of riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis .
riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo .
with the absence of <unk> enzymes <unk> a genetic disturbance in regulation of <unk> nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of <unk> .
the properties were studied for 680 time purified <unk> from cells of p. <unk> as well as for three phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at ph 3.5 , 5.5 and 8.6 , which are able of <unk> fmn .
a change in the content of <unk> and iron in the cells has no effect on the activity of <unk> in this species .
evidently , the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis regulation would be different in p. <unk> .
[ <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ] .
the ph optima were determined for <unk> and <unk> of the loach eggs .
for <unk> they are 5.6 and 7.6 and for <unk> - 5.2 and 7.2 .
it is established that <unk> activates , and <unk> has not effect on the activity of acid and alkaline <unk> , while <unk> , <unk> and especially <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> have an inhibitory effect on them .
the activities of <unk> is stimulated by <unk> and <unk> , and inhibited by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> do not affect these activities .
localization of the above mentioned enzymes was studied by means of differential centrifugation of egg <unk> .
acid dnase is concentrated only in <unk> supernatant liquid , its activity being inhibited in the presence of the <unk> and microsomal fractions .
acid rnase is also localized predominantly in <unk> supernatant fraction .
alkaline dnase is found to a great extent in <unk> fraction , and alkaline rnase - in <unk> one .
[ determination of optimal conditions for the <unk> detection of atpase activity in isolated nuclei ] .
the optimal conditions are selected for <unk> detection of the atpase activity in nuclei of the skeletal muscles of rabbits and nuclei of vicia faba l. meristem .
it is shown that the previous fixation of nuclei in the rabbit skeletal muscle for 10 min in a mixture of the buffer solutions of 4 % <unk> <unk> and 4 % neutral formalin ( 1:1 ) causes a decrease in their atpase activity by 78 % in the medium containing <unk> and by 34 % - in the medium containing <unk> ; in nuclei of horse bean seedlings meristem it lowers respectively by 28 and 16 % .
ions of lead in a concentration of 0.4 mm evoke a decrease in the atpase activity in the medium containing <unk> , in nuclei of the rabbit skeletal muscles by 35 % and in nuclei of horse bean meristem by 15 % in the medium containing <unk> .
the <unk> of the residual activity is sufficient for detection of the product of atp <unk> hydrolysis reaction by activity is sufficient for detection of the product of atp <unk> hydrolysis reaction by the method of electronic <unk> .
an increase in the <unk> concentration higher than 2.8 mm evokes <unk> hydrolysis of atp .
the atpase activity under the <unk> study is found within the range of ph <unk> .
the product of reaction forms most intensively at ph <unk> in the medium with both <unk> and <unk> .

in experiments on 30 animals and in observations over the course of acute closed <unk> trauma in 24 patients is was found that the course and prognosis of a posttraumatic period were dependent on the functional activity of the <unk> system and <unk> and <unk> processes .
based on the data obtained , it is concluded that the character of <unk> interrelations can serve as the prognostic criterion in <unk> traumas , whereas the information about these processes -- in selecting the appropriate therapy .
[ incarcerated gallbladder in cholecystitis ] .
among 206 examined patients with cholecystitis and similar diseases in 112 ( 65 % ) cases , as evidenced by the authors ' findings , the gallbladder proved to be non-functioning .
its escape in the biliary system was functional ( indirect ) or organic ( absolute ) .
the main causes of a direct organic escape of the gallbladder are as follows : destructive changes in its walls , strictures , strangulated gall stones , shrinkage or <unk> .
the reliable preoperative diagnosis of an escaped gallbladder by means of accelerated <unk> catheterization , intravenous ( <unk> ) or associated ( <unk> ) <unk> , correlated with the anamnesis data and clinical signs , rather speaks in favour of cholecystectomy on absolute indications .
[ determination of the proteolytic activity of beef liver by means of natural substrates <unk> with 125 i ] .
there is a description of the determination of the enzymatic activity of acid proteinases : the method is based on the use of <unk> natural protein substrates .
labelled albumin <unk> , globulin <unk> , and insulin <unk> were tested for the determination of activities .
all the substrates were hydrolyzed with the enzymes of the supernatant fraction ( 106 000 g ) of <unk> liver <unk> in the zone of acid ph .
optimum <unk> of enzymatic reaction were tested , the dependence of reaction on the concentration of the enzyme , on time , and on temperature was determined , ph optimum was ascertained for individual substrates , and ph stability was determined .
it follows from the results that the method is suitable for the determination of the enzymatic activity of proteinases of the cathepsin character .
significance of serum <unk> and <unk> ph levels in a field infection of o <unk> in lambs .
serum <unk> estimations from serially bled lambs grazing on pasture from spring to autumn showed correlations with the availability of <unk> larvae on pasture , with faecal egg counts of o <unk> , and with <unk> worm counts in similar lambs slaughtered <unk> from the same pasture .
in the slaughtered lambs correlations were recorded between worm count , serum <unk> level and <unk> ph .
the value of serum <unk> estimations as a diagnostic test is discussed with reference to these findings .
[ cultivation of trichomonas <unk> and trichomonas tenax on a <unk> medium ] .
studied was the possibility to isolate and culture <unk> <unk> and <unk> tenax on a medium <unk> , proposed by the authors for the isolation and cultivation of <unk> vaginalis .
the growth and development of the two trichomonas species were followed up at various temperatures -- 38 degrees , 36 degrees , and 32 degrees c , in order to establish the most appropriate temperature for continuous cultivation at longer intervals of reseeding as well as the temperature optimum for the fast deposition of great amounts of biomass .
it was found that the <unk> medium is suitable for the isolation and cultivation of <unk> <unk> and <unk> tenax .
temperatures of 38 degrees and 36 degrees contribute to the accumulation of greater amounts of biomass , while at 32 degrees c the growth of these protozoa is delayed and reseeding is to be carried out at greater intervals .

[ alkaline phosphatases in human feces , intestinal mucosa and bile , and the occurrence of <unk> in feces ( <unk> transl ) ] .
alkaline phosphatase ( ec <unk> ) in extracts of human feces resembles alkaline phosphatase in extracts of duodenal mucosa , except for its electrophoretic mobility in starch gel .
it is very probable that the normal feces alkaline phosphatase derives from intestinal mucosa .
gall bladder alkaline phosphatase , which is markedly different , has not been found in normal feces .
some patients with acute viral hepatitis or <unk> excrete an alkaline phosphatase which resembles gall bladder alkaline phosphatase and has the characteristics of <unk> ( ec <unk> ) .
the appearance of this enzyme correlates with low total alkaline phosphatase activity of the excreta .
simultaneous determination of <unk> and alkaline phosphatase activities in serum .
a simple method is described for the simultaneous determination of alkaline phosphatase ( ec <unk> ) and <unk> ( ec <unk> ) in serum .
the method is based on the determination of inorganic phosphorus released by the action of the two enzymes on <unk> at ph 9.5 ( 200 mmol/l <unk> ) in the presence and absence of l-cysteine .
this amino acid at a concentration of 2 -- 10 mmol/l was found to be a specific inhibitor for alkaline phosphatase but with no effect on <unk> activity .
absorption of short and medium chain fatty acids in the jejunum of the rat .
the uptake of the shortest six fatty acids ( acetic to <unk> ) was studied in vitro , using everted segments of rat jejunum .
the marked influence of <unk> and fatty acid <unk> suggests that non-ionic diffusion through the <unk> membrane is quantitatively the most important way of transport , but ionic diffusion through the membrane as well as transport through hydrophilic pores also seem to play a role .
though fatt acids evidently are accumulated in the <unk> , and saturation kinetics , competitive inhibition and <unk> as well as <unk> apparently are observed , the transport mechanism is assumed to involve solely passive diffusion , - the concept of a <unk> transport for short and medium chain fatty acids seems improbable .
carcinogenic <unk> from the reaction of the analgesic <unk> and nitrite extracted from foodstuffs .

1. weak activities of phosphorylase and aldolase and <unk> of <unk> and ldh were noticed mainly in the brush border of the tubules and <unk> cytoplasm .
a trace activity of <unk> was noticed in the brush border .
2. bilateral <unk> removal results in inhibition of both phosphorylase and aldolase .

b. pertussis suspension was tested by de voe et al. method ( 1970 ) and its modification with the solutions of a definite ionic composition and a lysozyme .
the best results were obtained by the following modification elaborated by the authors .
the microbes were grown on the <unk> agar for 36 hours and were washed with chilled 0.5 m nacl .
the suspension was washed 4 times with the same solution and then the precipitate was suspended in <unk> solution ( 0.5 m ) .
in 2 hours the <unk> was replaced by a solution of salts with lysozyme .
after a 2-hour incubation at 35 degrees c the substance was <unk> for 20 minutes and the precipitate suspended in the <unk> at ph 7.8 .
the following changes were observed : after the washing and incubation with <unk> there was seen a strong stretching and separation of the cell wall ( cw ) from the cytoplasmic membrane ( cpm ) ; cells without the cw were rarely revealed ; 2 ) after the lysozyme treatment there were many cells of spherical shape ( <unk> microscopy ) without any cw , limited by the cpm only .
morphologically they were no different from the true <unk> of the gram-positive bacteria .
the chemical analysis also confirmed a possibility of obtaining the true <unk> of the gram-negative bacteria .

by comparing the value of specific and <unk> indices it was revealed that the <unk> shifts preceded the maximal development of the immune response .
on the example of studying the catecholamine dynamics the opinion on a close association between the state of the regulatory mechanisms and the effector formations responsible for the formation of specific immunological reactions was confirmed .
it is suggested that a <unk> immunological response developed on condition of activation of the <unk> system .
[ covalent binding of peroxidase to <unk> and <unk> 4 b ] .
the properties of peroxidase <unk> by covalent binding to <unk> and <unk> 4 b in the presence of <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( edc ) are described .
<unk> 4 b bound peroxidase yields an enzyme preparation with a residual specific activity of 60.6 % .
when bound to <unk> 4 b , the residual specific activity is to 78 % .
the reasons of these differences in the catalytic activity of the two <unk> enzyme preparations are discussed .
by covalent binding on <unk> and <unk> 4 b , peroxidase <unk> no changes in its ph optimum ; it virtually keeps the same activity after being used ten times .
<unk> peroxidase preparations , dried and <unk> after being stored for 6 weeks at room temperature still display 50 % of the initial specific activity of the <unk> enzyme .
stored in acetate buffer , the enzyme preparations maintain their activity during all this interval .
<unk> <unk> <unk> urease .
purification and properties .
a method for the preparation of a <unk> purified and homogenous a. <unk> urease is reported .
the enzyme exhibited two ph optima at ph 7.0 and 7.5 in <unk> and phosphate buffer , respectively .
the affinity of the enzyme toward its substrate increased with the increase of ph .
no effect of the ph was observed on the measured temperature coefficient ( q10 ) .
there was no discontinuity in the arrhenius plots at ph 5.4 and 7.5 but an upward discontinuity at ph 6.15 and 8.7 with transition temperature at 30 degrees c .
also , the calculated activation energies are greatly affected by the ph of the enzyme reaction mixture .
further characterization of the association of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with reticulocyte membranes .
1. the behaviour and properties of membrane-bound <unk> of rabbit reticulocytes were investigated .
2. the bound <unk> is more resistant to inactivation by kcl than the soluble enzyme ( <unk> ) .
3. the bound enzyme is released by electrolytes .
this effect does not only depend on the ionic strength but additionally on the kind of ions , <unk> and protein concentration .
<unk> a comparison of the releasing effect of nad analogues shows the necessity of the <unk> moiety in the structure of the effector .
5. the represented results demonstrate the <unk> of the <unk> binding in rabbit reticulocytes .
[ effect of the vagus nerve on isolated rabbit atria in ganglionic blockade due to hexamethonium ] .
by quantitative stimulation of the vagus nerves of isolated rabbit atria <unk> relations were obtained for both the <unk> effect ( reduction of the area of the <unk> action potential ) and the inotropic response .
an addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10 ( -5 ) g/ml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation , and was connected with a shift of the <unk> characteristic to the right .
at higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased .
in contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible .
by raising the concentration up to 4-10 ( -5 ) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent , and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies .
in the range of 20 sec ( -1 ) to 100 sec ( -1 ) this dependence was re-established and may be considered as a part of a normal <unk> relation extremely shifted to the right .
the time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period .
a mathematical handling of the <unk> characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria ; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread <unk> of postganglionic fibres .
chemical relaxation studies on the system liver alcohol dehydrogenase , nadh and imidazole .
several years ago , <unk> and <unk> conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase , reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole , using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence .
these early experiments were repeated with improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in general terms .
however , the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around 3 ms .
furthermore , the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier ( by factor 2 ) .
the data were evaluated much more rigorously than before , allowing an appropriate interpretation of the results .
the observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes , which are faster than three ( of the four ) dissociation rate constants , determined previously by <unk> and <unk> this fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence .
however , the binding of imidazole to the binary <unk> complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes .
the observed signal derives largely from the ternary complex ( es ) .
a substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed relaxation process , suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in reference to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme .
nine models are considered with two types of coupling of <unk> ( <unk> ) .
quantitative evaluations favor the model with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the four-step ( bimolecular ) cycle .
the ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside .
the interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole .
if it would be shifted very much to the side of the `` dead-end '' complex ( as in <unk> ? ! ) , stimulating action could not take place .
preliminary experience in the treatment of schizophrenia with <unk> and its derivatives .
comparative study of virological infections in asthmatic and <unk> children .
the author shows complex analyses : clinical , laboratory , x-rays , <unk> , <unk> and measuring lung function tests as well as the serological examinations in blood serum of both groups of asthmatic and <unk> children with virological infection .
the calculation of statistically significant differences between the various <unk> results of both groups has confirmed that in asthmatic children virological infection of the respiratory tract , pathological findings in x-ray and lung function tests , bronchiectasis and secondary bacteriological invasion occurs statistically significantly more often than in <unk> children .
acute otitis media .
a clinical bacteriological and serological study of children with frequent episodes of acute otitis media .
a series of episodes of acute otitis media was studied with reference to bacterial findings and specific serological responses in 48 children with histories of frequent episodes before .
d. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were the most frequently isolated pathogens .
<unk> after therapy were often made in episodes with slow healing or therapeutic failure .
most children harboured pathogens in nasopharynx even when they had no signs of respiratory tract infections .
homologous relapses were seen only in few cases and never with pneumococcus type 3 and only once with h. influenzae type b .
specific serological responses were demonstrable generally in children over 2 years of age .
d. pneumococcus type 3 and h. influenzae type b generally provoked antibody response .
no levels indicating immunoglobulin deficiencies could be found in the children .
multiple forms of staphylococcal <unk> .
a group of proteins was readily extracted at neutrality from <unk> acid precipitates of staphylococcal culture filtrate <unk> , while <unk> was dissolved and activated by treating the precipitate with 8 m urea , with acidic buffers or by heating to 90-100 degrees c at neutrality .
heat activation of the precipitate produced a relatively pure <unk> with a molecular weight of 39,000 .
<unk> was eluted together with three other proteins on hydroxyl apatite chromatography , and evidence was obtained for an association between the four proteins .
on isoelectric focusing a haemolytic fraction was obtained at ph 6.2 , probably due to acid activation of the precipitate formed at the cathodic end of the column .
the <unk> fractions with <unk> of 7.4 and 8.6 were shown to consist of <unk> only when analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate .
the haemolytic component with a pi of 9.2 contained two additional components of molecular weights of 27,500 and 18,000 .
chromatography of this material on <unk> <unk> showed that <unk> and the two proteins appeared as a high molecular complex .

epidemiologic investigations of the 1969 epidemic of venezuelan encephalitis in ecuador .
an <unk> of venezuelan equine encephalitis ( vee ) , subtype i variant b , occurred in ecuador during the rainy and hot season of 1969 .
in this paper , a general description of the epidemic is given and virus isolations from humans are reported .
a serologic survey was performed in order to determine the extension of the epidemic along the coastal zone of the country .
it is not clear whether the higher antibody rate in older people was because they were at greater risk of infection or was the result of an accumulated immunity with time .
the latter could be an indication of endemic virus activity , not yet proven for the vee ib virus variant .
mosquito surveillance and attempted control by aerial spraying were carried out .
congenital malformations of the central nervous system produced by narcotic analgesics in the hamster .
maternal dose -- fetal teratogenic response data were obtained for a variety of narcotic and related compounds by single subcutaneous injections of the drugs into pregnant hamsters during the critical periods of central nervous system organogenesis .
the number of abnormal fetuses from females injected with diacetylmorphine ( heroin ) , thebaine , <unk> , <unk> , propoxyphene , and methadone increased as the maternal dose of the compounds was increased .
by contrast , morphine , hydromorphone , and meperidine produced an increase in the number ( per cent ) of fetal anomalies only up to a certain maternal dose level .
further increases in maternal dose levels did not produce additional fetal anomalies .
comparative studies of single and multiple maternal doses indicated that diacetylmorphine ( heroin ) and methadone produced a <unk> to sixfold increase in fetal anomalies with repetitive doses whereas the percentage of malformed fetuses remained the same with hydromorphone ( dilaudid ) .
the narcotic antagonists <unk> , naloxone , <unk> , and <unk> blocked the teratogenic effects of both single and multiple doses of the narcotics .
evaluation of a non-professional visual screening method .
a screening method designed for administration by lay personnel is evaluated and compared to modified clinical technique screening results for a screening of 1600 elementary school children .
ionic requirements of proximal tubular sodium transport .
ii .
hydrogen ion .
simultaneous perfusion to proximal convoluted tubules and <unk> capillaries was used to study the effects of different perfusion fluids on sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion , which was calculated as bicarbonate reabsorption and <unk> acid .
results show that sodium reabsorption was not tightly coupled to hydrogen secretion .
bicarbonate stimulates both sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion , but tris stimulates only sodium reabsorption .
imposing an adverse chloride gradient across the proximal tubule ( <unk> <unk> greater than <unk> luminal ) decreased sodium reabsorption but did not diminish hydrogen secretion .
diamox inhibited both net sodium and hydrogen transport .
it is concluded that there is not firm linkage between sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion and that bicarbonate probably stimulates sodium transport by a number of mechanisms , including an effect on the sodium transport unrelated to its ability to increase hydrogen ion secretion .
ecs , intracellular ph , and electrolytes of cardiac and skeletal muscle .
the extracellular space ( ecs ) of muscle from each ventricle of the heart ( rv and lv ) , the atria , diaphragm , and quadriceps was estimated in the anesthetized rabbit from the distribution volumes of [ 14c ] insulin , [ 14c ] sucrose , [ <unk> ] edta , and c1 -- .
<unk> electrolytes were measured and intracellular electrolytes calculated .
the ecs of the tissues varied , increasing in the order quadriceps less than lv less than rv less than atria .
the volume of distribution of [ 14c ] inulin was always less than that of either [ 14c ] sucrose or [ <unk> ] edta which agreed closely , whereas that of c1 -- was always greater .
there was no difference in intracellular <unk> in muscle from each of the cardiac chambers , whereas intracellular <unk> and c1 -- varied , increasing in the order quadriceps less than lv less than rv less than atria .
intracellular ph , measured with [ 14c ] dmo did not differ in any of the tissues studied .
it is concluded that , in vivo , the estimated ecs <unk> muscle is lower than that reported in vitro , that [ <unk> ] edta is a satisfactory ecs marker , and that differences in intracellular <unk> and c1 -- but not <unk> or ph exist between muscle from the cardiac chambers .
intracellular ph and <unk> of cardiac and skeletal muscle in acidosis and alkalosis .
the effects of a metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis on intracellular ph ( phi ) and <unk> have been compared in cardiac and skeletal muscle from the anesthetized rabbit .
the extracellular space and phi were calculated from the distribution volumes of [ <unk> ] edta and [ 14c ] dmo , respectively .
when phe was varied by altering pco2 , the slope of the line relating phi to the extracellular ph ( phe ) was greater ( p less than 0.05 -- 0.001 ) than that obtained during metabolic changes of phe in right and left ventricles , atria , diaphragm , and quadriceps .
during metabolic acidosis and alkalosis , the slope of <unk> line did not vary between tissues .
during respiratory acidosis , there was no difference in slope between cardiac tissues , but it was less in left ventricle than quadriceps ( p less than 0.001 ) .
in left ventricle intracellular <unk> increased in a metabolic ( p less than 0.05 ) or respiratory acidosis ( p less than 0.02 ) , whereas in diaphragm it decreased ( p less than 0.02 ) .
intracellular <unk> correlated with phe and <unk> .
changes in phi but not intracellular <unk> could explain known differences in myocardial function in respiratory and metabolic acidosis .
effects of autonomic <unk> on transmembrane potentials of atrial plateau fibers .
isolated canine atrial plateau fibers were treated with acetylcholine or norepinephrine to note the effects on the transmembrane potential .
acetylcholine , 1.0 or 2.0 <unk> , consistently reduced the slope of inherent phase 4 depolarization .
increases in maximum diastolic potential and rising velocity occurred along with a decrease in overshoot .
the plateau phase disappeared .
pretreatment with atropine , 1.0 <unk> , prevented these responses , and alone this drug had no discernible effect .
norepinephrine consistently increased the slope of phase 4 depolarization .
frequently plateau fibers generated action potentials by the normal pacemaker mechanism .
`` arrhythmias '' characterized by spontaneous excitations were induced in 92 % of the norepinephrine experiments .
norepinephrine also enhanced the plateau phase of the action potential and decreased the rising velocity and overshoot .
racemic propranolol , 1.0 <unk> , blocked all the above effects including arrhythmias .
<unk> , 1.0 <unk> , did not block effects produced by norepinephrine .
acetylcholine , applied to fibers under treatment with norepinephrine , reduced the slope of <unk> phase 4 depolarization and terminated induced arrhythmias .
interstitial fluid pressure and alkaline gastric secretion .
the interstitial fluid pressure of the submucosa of the gastric fundus was monitored by means of <unk> capsules in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital .
the <unk> pressure ( icp ) was measured during secretion produced by : a ) hypertonic solutions placed inside the stomach ; b ) arterial hypertension ( 200 mmhg ) applied during <unk> infusion of histamine , and c ) <unk> infusion of acetylcholine .
the first procedure did not modify the icp .
on the other hand , whenever interstitial fluid appeared in the gastric lumen during hypertension plus histamine , the mean icp increased , mostly due to augmented capillary filtration .
the hydraulic coefficient measured in these experiments was at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than the respective osmotic coefficient .
the action of acetylcholine was complex : large doses enlarged the net capillary filtration , but small doses increased the mean icp by muscle stimulation only .
contraction of the muscularis <unk> might be the most important mechanism underlying bulk flow of interstitial fluid in physiological conditions .
it is concluded that hydraulic gradients across the epithelium might account for the `` secretion '' of `` alkaline '' juice .
overview : maintenance therapy in psychiatry : i. schizophrenia .
hospital psychiatry has evolved from long-term `` treatment '' programs that were primarily custodial to the successful pharmacological treatment of acute psychotic episodes .
unfortunately , many patients still return to the hospital with relapses .
this so-called revolving door syndrome draws attention to the critical importance of preventing as well as treating acute episodes .
in the first part of this overview , the author reviews the clinical literature on prophylactic treatment of schizophrenia with maintenance antipsychotic drugs .
the second part will review the literature on prophylactic treatment of affective disorders with lithium and tricyclics .
in the opinion of the author these drugs provide the potential for truly preventive psychiatry .
inpatient and outpatient patterns of psychotropic drug prescribing by <unk> physicians .
the authors found that among 228 general hospital patients , minor tranquilizers were prescribed most often and with the least justification and that major tranquilizers were prescribed sparingly and by and large judiciously .
antidepressants were given less often than would be justified by the incidence of depressive illness among these patients .
<unk> of depression in patients with somatic complaints and autonomic signs of depression contributed to this lack of treatment .

protective effect of hypothermia in cerebral oxygen deficiency caused by arterial hypoxia .
to study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia , anesthetized ( 70 % n2o ) , mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body temperature of 27 c .
hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent .
this reduced mean <unk> to about 25 and 11-12 torr , respectively .
at <unk> torr , there was no change in cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) , <unk> oxygen consumption ( <unk> ) , or labile tissue metabolites .
the absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and ph on the <unk> dissociation curve .
thus , at 27 c with a <unk> of 25 torr the total oxygen content ( <unk> ) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml ( 100 ml ) -1 , about three times the value obtained at this po2 in <unk> rats .
at <unk> 11-12 torr , arterial <unk> was reduced to about 5 ml ( 100 ml ) ( -1 ) .
the hypoxia induced no change in <unk> , a threefold increase in cbf , a moderate <unk> in the tissue , and a small decrease in <unk> content , but no change in atp , adp , or amp .
these changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial <unk> in <unk> rats .
it is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia , and that two mechanisms are involved .
first , since hypothermia shifts the <unk> curve towards the left , and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis , it maintains a high <unk> in arterial blood at a given <unk> .
second , by reducing <unk> , and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements , hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level .

characterization of a <unk> herpesvirus .
a virus , which was isolated from kids ( capra <unk> ) affected with a relatively severe generalized infection , was found to contain dna and to have a buoyant density of <unk> g/cm3 .
the virus was sensitive to the action of lipid solvents and trypsin and was rapidly inactivated at ph 3.0 and at temperatures of 50 and 56 c .
the virion , an icosahedron consisting of a <unk> surrounded by a double membrane , measured approximately 135 nm in diameter .
on the basis of its chemical and physical properties , the virus is considered a herpesvirus .
transfer of drugs across the <unk> wall in goats .
the rates at which pentobarbital , salicylate , <unk> , and quinine were transferred from the rumen of intact , conscious goats were measured .
the rates at which the same drugs diffused from the blood plasma ( under conditions of constant drug concentration ) into the <unk> solution were also evaluated .
these compounds were absorbed by simple diffusion , and the rates of transfer were a function of ph of the <unk> solution .
the diffusion of drugs from plasma into the <unk> allowed steady-state distributions to be established in some goats .
the theoretical and observed steady-state distributions were compared .
there were good correlations for pentobarbital and <unk> , but not for salicylate and quinine .
these findings confirm in vivo the general principles of drug transfer across <unk> epithelium that were derived from previous studies conducted in vitro .
preservation of hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in canine pneumococcal pneumonia .
to determine the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pneumococcal pneumonia , hemodynamic measurements were made in 16 dogs before , and within 36 hours after , <unk> administration of type iii pneumococcus .
ten dogs with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary vascular resistances and slightly decreased their arterial o2 tensions .
hypoxia increased and <unk> decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances .
during o2 breathing , arterial po2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung .
in 2 dogs breathing air , forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by o2 breathing .
in 5 dogs , lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia .
in pneumococcal pneumonia , the hypoxic pulmonary pressor mechanism serves to decrease blood flow to the diseased lobes and , thus , to maintain the arterial po2 .
lung mast cells could participate in this response .
value of capillary blood gas analyses in the management of acute respiratory distress .
a comparative study of blood gases and acid-base parameters , obtained simultaneously from arterial and finger capillary samples , was performed in 45 patients in acute respiratory distress without circulatory shock .
although small and significant differences were found between the 2 sample ph , po2 , pco2 , and bicarbonate values , the correlations between the 2 were greater than or equal to 0.97 for each variable .
it was concluded that although the arterial blood is the preferred sample for evaluation of blood gases and acid-base status of patients in acute respiratory distress , capillary blood appears to be a valid substitute in the management of these patients .
this technique is particularly valuable in pediatric practice , where repeated arterial samples are less easily obtained .
bone marrow transplantation in man .
bone marrow transplantation is emerging as a viable therapeutic approach to a number of diseases that are usually or uniformly fatal .
we review here recent experiences in bone marrow transplantation in man at ucla and in various other institutions throughout the world .
we examine marrow transplantation in immunodeficiency diseases , acute leukemia , and aplastic anemia and consider the problems of infection in the transplant recipients .
the applications of tissue typing to marrow transplantation and immunologic manipulations , which may influence <unk> and graft-versus-host disease , are also reported .
the virus hypothesis in systemic lupus erythematosus .
<unk> viruses are currently the prime etiologic candidates in systemic lupus erythematosus .
on the basis of knowledge gained from studies of experimental and human models of chronic viral disease , there are possible <unk> roles of a virus in systemic lupus erythematosus .
experimental attempts at implicating specific viruses have been predominantly negative , but evidence for enhanced <unk> expression has recently been reported .

<unk> alterations in <unk> synthetase .
the levels of <unk> synthetase in various rat tissues including those undergoing differentiation or regeneration revealed that the enzyme is related to tissue proliferation and differentiation .
in the liver upon neoplastic transformation , the level of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase rises and the liver form of the enzyme having a pi at 5.0 is replaced by a form with a pi of 4.1 .
since the latter form has also been found present in whole embryos ( <unk> and 14-day ) and brain , the molecular alterations of <unk> synthetase in liver neoplasia can be considered to be <unk> .
a <unk> alkaline phosphatase , the kasahara isozyme , compared with one of the isozymes of fl amnion cells .
it was found that a human <unk> alp ( <unk> monoester phosphohydrolase , e.c. <unk> ) shared electrophoretic mobility , inactivation by urea , inhibition by inorganic phosphate , <unk> , and amino acids ( l-phenylalanine , <unk> and <unk> ) , heat stability , sensitivity to neuraminidase , ph optimum , km value , and antigen site with fast moving alp isozymes of fl cell strain derived from human amniotic membrane .
however , <unk> fresh amniotic membrane lacked this isozyme .
instead , it had a placental type alp consisting of minor components .
the other alp isozyme of fl cells had properties common to <unk> alp with regard to l-phenylalanine sensitivity , inhibition by <unk> , inactivation by urea , and antigen site , but differed from it in electrophoretic mobility , sensitivity to <unk> and <unk> , and the presence of another antigen site .
it was more heat stable and more sensitive to inhibition by inorganic phosphate than <unk> ap .
the possible regulatory mechanism between the <unk> alp and the placental type alp in the amnion cells is considered .
<unk> <unk> .
a sensitive indicator of renal ischaemic injury in experimental animals and renal <unk> rejection in man .
the sites of ischaemic injury within the kidney are reviewed and the diagnostic value of measurements of plasma and urinary enzymes in renal ischaemic injury and in renal <unk> rejection in experimental animals and man is examined .
<unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) is an enzyme primarily located in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney .
its unique localization in the cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay provide the rationale for its use in the measurement and diagnosis of renal ischaemic injury .
<unk> activity was measured in dogs undergoing varying periods of renal ischaemia and under conditions of local renal hypothermia and was shown to be a sensitive indicator of ischaemic injury .
twenty consecutive patients undergoing renal <unk> were studied by daily estimation of their <unk> urinary <unk> activity ; excellent correlation was obtained between raised levels of this enzyme and the clinical diagnosis of transplant rejection .
influence of ph on the heat inactivation of staphylococcal enterotoxin a as determined by monkey feeding and serological assay .
the effect of ph on the thermal inactivation of staphylococcal enterotoxin a was investigated .
analysis of heated toxin by <unk> in gel indicated that enterotoxin a in beef bouillon was inactivated faster at ph 5.3 than at ph 6.2 .
the z values ( slopes ) for the heat inactivation curves at ph 6.2 and 5.3 were 49.5 and 55 f ( about 27 and 30 c ) , respectively .
enterotoxin produced and heated in <unk> <unk> acids medium and assayed by monkey feeding was more easily inactivated by heat at ph 5.3 than at ph 7.8 .
thermal inactivation curves for enterotoxin a in beef bouillon ( 5 <unk> , ph 5.3 ) were determined by two methods , monkey feeding and serological assay .
the z values for the curves obtained by these two methods were both 55 f , although loss of biological or toxic activity of the enterotoxin occurred before loss of serological activity .
survival of <unk> during pepperoni manufacture .
survival of <unk> in artificially contaminated <unk> mixtures ( approximately 10 ( 4 ) <unk> ) was studied in pepperoni prepared by either a natural flora or lactic starter culture fermentation or in <unk> sausages .
the pepperoni did not become <unk> free during the usual commercial 15 to 30-day drying period .
salmonella dublin was present in all products , fermented or unfermented , after 42 to 43 days of drying .
at a lower level of contamination , 10 ( 3 ) <unk> , s. dublin could not be recovered from starter <unk> pepperoni after 14 days of drying but persisted in the natural <unk> sausage .
s. typhimurium ( initial count , 10 ( 4 ) <unk> ) was absent after 42 days of drying when starter culture was used to ferment the pepperoni , but was still present in the natural <unk> and unfermented products .
s. dublin , host adapted to cattle , or s. <unk> , host adapted to swine , had similar survival patterns in beef pork , or <unk> pepperoni .
heating <unk> contaminated <unk> pepperoni ( after <unk> but before drying ) to an internal temperature of 60 c ( <unk> inactivating ) eliminated the food-borne pathogen from the sausage product .
growth of staphylococcus and salmonella on frankfurters with and without sodium nitrite .
conventional and <unk> frankfurters in loosely wrapped packages were compared as to their ability to support growth of salmonella , staphylococcus , and their naturally occurring spoilage flora at 7 c ( simulating refrigerated storage ) and 20 c ( simulating possible temperature abuse ) .
at 7 c salmonella did not grow in either type of frankfurter ; staphylococcus and the natural spoilage flora sometimes grew more rapidly in the absence of nitrite , but the difference was not significant .
at 20 c growth of salmonella , staphylococcus , and of the spoilage flora was , at most , only slightly faster on <unk> frankfurters .
salmonella was not suppressed in broth culture experiments the ph and nitrite content found in frankfurters .
although either type of frankfurter can become hazardous due to growth of salmonella or staphylococcus , no unusual or additional hazard resulted from the omission of nitrite from frankfurters .
characterization of an extracellular <unk> from fusarium <unk> .
an extracellular <unk> ( ec <unk> ) was purified approximately <unk> from cell-free culture <unk> of fusarium <unk> .
the purified <unk> was of the endo type , and <unk> was identified as the primary end product of dextran hydrolysis .
the molecular weight of the <unk> was determined to be 39,000 by gel permeation chromatography .
the enzyme was most active at ph 5.5 , and the temperature optimum was near 55 c .
activity was not inhibited by either <unk> acid or <unk> .
the km for dextran with an average molecular weight of 10,000 was estimated to be 1.1 x 10 ( -4 ) m .
the electrophoretic mobility of the <unk> was distinctly different from that of a <unk> commercial <unk> .
the f. <unk> <unk> was also found to differ from the commercial preparation by its greater relative activity against <unk> isolated from streptococcus mutans .
<unk> <unk> in acid mine water .

graft versus host reaction .
an ultrastructural study .
graft versus host reaction ( <unk> ) following <unk> transfusions occurred in a 34-year-old man with a generalized <unk> .
histologic and ultrastructural studies were performed , with special reference to <unk> cells scattered in the epidermis .
these cells are usually considered to be a constant and important feature of <unk> reaction .
dense aggregation of <unk> , including cytoplasmic organelles and loss of desmosomes , were seen in <unk> cells .
several intracellular desmosomes with <unk> bound to their attachment plaque were observed .
some of these cells were able to reach the horny layer ; some others were <unk> by neighboring keratinocytes .
these cells could be the result of a toxic damage to the epidermis , provoked by the immunologic phenomenon implicated in <unk> reaction .
later in the clinical course , bullae formations occurred , showing some features of toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) , as well as features of <unk> reaction .
nephrotic syndrome in indian children .
a <unk> study of 206 indian children with nephrotic syndrome showed a primary renal cause in 195 ( 96 % ) , of which 77 % were boys .
in 126 children ( 96 boys , 30 girls ) onset of the disorder occurred before the age of 5 years .
renal biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients ( 77 % ) ; in 85 of these biopsy was done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome .
significant renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as <unk> 8 , <unk> 4 , proliferative with extensive crescents 2 , membranous 3 , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9 , focal global glomerulosclerosis 2 , advanced nonspecific 8 , and mild proliferative 9 .
<unk> manifestations were mainly associated with significant renal lesions , which were more frequently encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years .
clearance of proteinuria with corticosteroid therapy was practically confined to patients with minimal or mild renal histological changes .
our findings suggest that the pattern of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in indian children is similar to that reported from western countries .
separation of <unk> ( <unk> ) of normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales by <unk> .
normal stratum corneum and psoriatic scales were homogenized and a differential centrifugation was performed .
the dnase activity of the individual fractions was investigated by <unk> .
at ph 5 only in the <unk> pellet and <unk> supernatant of normal keratin dnase activity could be observed .
however , all psoriatic fractions showed distinct enzyme activities .
at ph 7.4 little psoriatic dnase activity could only be demonstrated in the <unk> supernatant .
except from the <unk> pellet all fractions of normal stratum corneum displayed marked activities .
in addition the <unk> supernatant showed two different dnase bands .
subcellular distribution of phosphatases , proteinases , and <unk> in normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales .
the subcellular distribution of phosphatases , proteinases , and <unk> of normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales was determined after differential centrifugation .
all psoriatic enzymes showed much increased activities as compared to the normal stratum corneum enzymes .
the highest activities of alkaline phosphatase from psoriatic scales could be detected in the nuclear fraction .
the main activities of all other tested phosphatases and proteinases were present in the <unk> fraction .
the subcellular distribution of the <unk> varied according to the ph value .
a reinvestigation of the sites of transcription and translation of euglena <unk> <unk> synthetase .
an attempt was made to determine the sites of chloroplast <unk> synthetase transcription and translation .
inhibitors of bacterial rna and protein synthesis were added to logarithmic and stationary phase cultures of euglena gracilis wild-type b .
logarithmic phase cultures were sensitive to both types of inhibitors .
in stationary phase cultures plastid synthetase was reduced by rna but not by protein synthesis inhibitors .
the effect of the antibiotics on the mitochondrial enzyme was also noted .
several possible explanations of these <unk> are discussed .
[ hyperthermia in the <unk> ii. studies on influencing respiration with <unk> hyperthermia ] .
rectal temperature , respiratory rate , arterial and venous ph and arterial and venous pco2 were recorded at intervals of 15-30 minutes in female broiler rabbits exposed an environmental temperature of 35 degrees c , until they died .
respiratory rate and blood ph rose , and pco2 fell , until a rectal temperature of 42 degrees c was reached .
upon further increase in rectal temperature the respiratory rate and ph began to fall , while pco2 began to rise .
the rabbits died when rectal temperature reached 43 degrees c .
features of respiratory function peculiar to the rabbit were discussed .
outpatient phenothiazine use and bone marrow depression .
a report from the drug epidemiology unit and the boston collaborative drug surveillance program .
<unk> bone marrow depression ( bmd ) was evaluated in three separate but complementary data bases : ( 1 ) among 1,048 patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals , there was no evidence of subclinical depression of the white blood cell ( wbc ) count attributable to <unk> used before admission .
( 2 ) among <unk> medical inpatients , there were 34 patients admitted for bmd in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy ; one of the latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride , but it is doubtful whether this drug was the cause of the bmd .
( 3 ) among <unk> medical , surgical , and gynecological patients surveyed over a ten-month period in 1972 , there were four who were admitted for bmd ; one of the latter had a reversible leukopenia attributed to <unk> hydrochloride .
[ tumour <unk> through intravenous glucose infusion enhanced by amygdalin and <unk> application ( <unk> transl ) ] .
tumour <unk> in otherwise moderately <unk> tumours or tumour regions of ds <unk> wistar rats attained by glucose infusion was substantially increased by simultaneous infusion of amygdalin and <unk> i.m. or i.v. application of <unk> .
here the ph value of healthy tissue , measured at the <unk> muscle , remained unchanged .
by means of the said process , tumour <unk> has been raised to a level of <unk> <unk> ; attaining a ph difference between <unk> and normal tissue of up to <unk> = 1.6 .
in one case , the slope of ph reduction in the tumour increased to 870 % .
moreover , combined administration of glucose , amygdalin and <unk> evoked a significant <unk> effect <unk> , tumour regression ) being comparable with the action of an <unk> dosage of 150 <unk> .
however , i.m. and i.v. application of <unk> under narcosis results in an overall process that still remains somewhat too toxic .
hence optimizing studies are intended with the particular aim to further improve the comparability of this process .
[ determination of <unk> in mixed solvents ( <unk> transl ) ] .
studies of the pain produced by <unk> acetate preparations in burns .
in a double-blind triple cross-over clinical study , 37 patients were exposed to several formulations of <unk> acetate ( <unk> cream ) and their pain responses were recorded and converted to a <unk> pain index .
the 11.2 % concentration in cream was two to three times more painful than the 5 % concentration .
<unk> and not the ph level appears to be the cause of the pain produced by the high ( 11.2 % ) concentration .
the <unk> of the cream carrier and 11.2 % <unk> acetate are 1,080 <unk> and 1,100 <unk> , respectively , for a total of 2,180 <unk> .
the carrier cream without glycerol and a 5 % concentration of <unk> cream were much less painful than the 11.2 % concentration of <unk> .
both afforded a great deal of relief to the patients who received the medications .
<unk> growth in lipid emulsions used in parenteral nutrition .
parenteral nutrition via central venous catheterization is associated with serious risks , especially that of sepsis .
lipid emulsion ( <unk> [ sweden ] ) , which may be administered peripherally , was evaluated for its potential to support microbial growth .
washed cultures of staphylococcus aureus , candida albicans , and three species of gram-negative rods were all capable of multiplying in the emulsion at room temperature .
variations in inoculum size did not affect the growth rate .
studies comparing the emulsion to amino <unk> solutions ( total parenteral nutrition [ tpn ] ) confirmed other reports that tpn inhibits the growth of certain bacteria but merely retards fungal multiplication .
when human serum was added to the lipid emulsion in an attempt to simulate in vivo conditions at the catheter tip , escherichia coli was inhibited while the growth of s aureus and c <unk> was unaltered .
propoxyphene and <unk> tissue concentrations in fatalities associated with propoxyphene hydrochloride and propoxyphene <unk> .
propoxyphene and its major metabolite <unk> have been determined in blood and liver in 29 cases of death in which propoxyphene , either as the hydrochloride or as the <unk> salt , was involved .
the use of propoxyphene <unk> ( <unk> ) contributed to the deaths of 4 persons , 3 of whom were former heroin addicts receiving large amounts of this drug in connection with propoxyphene substitution programs .
in the majority of cases the <unk> blood concentrations exceed the propoxyphene concentrations , although brain determinations in several instances indicate that <unk> does not cross the blood-brain barrier with the same ease as propoxyphene .
on the basis of the comparative toxicities of propoxyphene and <unk> in animals and the high tissue concentrations of <unk> in man after propoxyphene administration , it is conceivable that <unk> contributes to the toxic effects of propoxyphene .
[ morphological manifestations and morphogenesis of the graft vs. host reaction in the brain of f1 hybrids following the administration of parental lymphoid cells and its effect on tumor inoculation ] .
it was established that intracerebral introduction of 10 min parental cells of the spleen brought about in hybrids ( <unk> ) f1 <unk> changes ( development of lymphocytic infiltrations , dystrophy in the nerve cells , myelin fibres and <unk> ) the intensity of which was found to be considerably higher in cases of injection of parental spleen cells from specifically sensitized donors .
spleen cells of mice cba produced much greater changes as compared with those produced by spleen cells of mice <unk> .
inoculation into the mice brain of 10 mln of spleen cells together with tumour in a dose of 1500 cells produced a clear cut inhibitory effect on the tumour growth , this effect being more pronounced following introduction of sensitized cells of the spleen of mice cba .
<unk> leukodystrophy .
ultrastructural and enzymatic study of a case of variant o form .
a variant of <unk> leukodystrophy ( mld ) , austin disease , is characterized by a multiple isozyme deficiency of <unk> .
a 3 <unk> girl with progressive mental and physical deterioration had decreased activities of <unk> a and b in the leukocytes , shown by <unk> gel electrophoresis .
under the electron microscope , biopsy specimens of the brain and the peripheral nerve showed lamellar structures with socalled zebra bodies in the cytoplasmic processes of glial cells , <unk> inclusions with fingerprint configurations in neurons , and <unk> material in schwann cells .
results from our study suggest an intricate nature of this <unk> disorder , which shows ultrastructural changes usually seen in classic mld , a deficiency of <unk> a only , concomitant with those seen in <unk> such as hurler and sanfilippo syndromes .
changes in the acid base status of sheep <unk> with a combination of atropine sulphate <unk> and ketamine hydrochloride .
ph , <unk> , <unk> , standard bicarbonate , base excess and reduced ph were measured in sheep before and at regular intervals after administration of ketamine with and without atropine and <unk> <unk> .
a decrease in ph and <unk> and a rise in <unk> was observed 15 minutes after administration of ketamine .
administration of atropine with and without <unk> had no significant effect on ph , <unk> and <unk> .
the values for standard bicarbonate , base excess and reduced ph were not significantly affected .
this indicates that minor changes observed in ph , <unk> after ketamine administration are compensated for by the healthy <unk> blood buffer system .
influence of some physical factors on survival of <unk> disease vaccine virus .
<unk> <unk> disease ( md ) vaccine was suspended at dilutions normally used for vaccination in seven commercially available <unk> and in <unk> phosphate broth .
the stability of diluted vaccines was determined by assay in cell cultures subjected to 0 to 37 c for 0 to 90 minutes .
optimum holding temperatures for md vaccine virus survival varied with the specific <unk> employed .
some <unk> afforded greatest survival when dilution was at 0 c and held at 0 c , while others performed best when dilution was at 25 c followed by cooling and holding at 0 c .
<unk> which allowed greatest survival when tested at 37 c also performed well under other temperature regimes .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and various buffering compounds were added to commercial <unk> used for diluting md vaccine .
additives producing osmolality of 745 <unk> and higher markedly reduced vaccine virus survival .
the adverse effects of high osmotic pressure were accentuated by extended holding time , elevated incubation temperature , and physical manipulations including mechanical mixing or expressing through a syringe and needle .
satisfactory md vaccine virus survival was afforded by a commercial diluent especially formulated to accommodate the ph osmolality changes produced by adding <unk> <unk> <unk> .
molecular nature of beta-galactosidase from different tissues in two strains of the house mouse .
one inbred mouse strain , <unk> , has high <unk> activities in all tissues while another strain , <unk> , has low activities determined by the bgs locus .
beta-galactosidase from these two strains was partly purified by a <unk> procedure : acidification , ammonium sulfate precipitation , gel filtration at two phs , and isoelectric focusing .
no qualitative differences were found between the enzyme preparations from the two strains .
they had identical heat inactivation curves , ph optima , molecular weight , and isoelectric points , and the km values were very similar .
it thus seems that this genetic difference in enzyme activity probably can not be explained by a variation of the <unk> activity but rather reflects a difference in number of enzyme molecules .
eight different isoenzymes were separated from liver , kidney , and spleen .
each isoenzyme has a different electrophoretic mobility and there is a stepwise increase in molecular weight from 143,000 to 380,000 beginning with the protein having the lowest isoelectric point .
a likely interpretation is that the isoenzymes bind a smaller polypeptide in varying numbers in addition to the enzymatic polypeptide per se .
the effects of acute and chronic nicotine hydrogen ( + ) <unk> administration and subsequent withdrawal on rat liver tryptophan <unk> activity and their comparison with those of morphine , <unk> and ethanol .
acute administration of nicotine hydrogen ( + ) <unk> enhances the activity of rat liver tryptophan <unk> by a hormonal mechanism .
chronic nicotine treatment inhibits , and subsequent withdrawal enhances , the <unk> activity .
the inhibition during chronic treatment is not due to a defective <unk> synthesis nor a decreased cofactor availability .
regeneration of liver <unk> in vitro and in vivo reverses the inhibition .
chronic nicotine administration increases the liver nadph concentration .
the above effects of nicotine resemble to a remarkable degree those previously shown for morphine , <unk> and ethanol .
all effects are compared , and their possible significance in relation to drug dependence is discussed .
plastid development in primary leaves of phaseolus vulgaris .
development of plastid adenosine <unk> activity during greening .
the <unk> of <unk> bean leaves showed atpase ( adenosine <unk> ) activity which had a ph optimum of 8.5 , was stimulated by <unk> and unaffected by <unk> .
bean chloroplasts showed a low activity of <unk> atpase with a ph optimum of 8.5 and a substantial amount of <unk> activity with a ph optimum of 8.0 .
the <unk> activity depended on <unk> and <unk> and was promoted by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> atpase activity was completely inhibited by <unk> .
<unk> developed <unk> atpase activity in response to 30 min illumination of the <unk> leaves .
during the 48 h of <unk> greening of <unk> leaves there was a 70 % increase of the chloroplast atpase activity found after <unk> and a 30 % fall in the <unk> activity , both expressed on a per leaf basis .
as the larger part of these changes occurred during the first 30 min of illumination , it is concluded that most or all of the chloroplast atpase was present in the <unk> , a conclusion identical with that of lockshin et al. ( 1971 ) for maize .
during 48 h of greening there was a tenfold increase in the amount of thylakoid membrane in the leaf together with an 83 % fall in the atpase activity per m2 of thylakoid membrane , measured after <unk> .
tricarboxylic <unk> and related enzymes in restricted facultative <unk> .
the isolation is described of pure cultures of three <unk> <unk> bacteria which , together with the previously described bacillus <unk> , have a very limited range of growth substrates ; these organisms are designated `` restricted facultative ' <unk> .
two of these isolates , <unk> and <unk> , grow only on glucose out of 50 <unk> compounds tested , whereas the third isolate <unk> and bacillus <unk> grow on betaine , glucose , gluconate , alanine , glutamate , citrate and nutrient agar , but not on any of a further 56 <unk> compounds .
crude sonic extracts of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> isolates , and of <unk> <unk> ( an obligate <unk> ) contain ( i ) no detectable <unk> dehydrogenase activity , ( ii ) very low or zero specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and succinyl-coa synthetase and ( iii ) <unk> isocitrate dehydrogenase activity .
extracts of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have ( i ) very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase specific activities , ( ii ) comparatively high specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase , malate dehydrogenase and succinyl-coa synthetase and ( iii ) <unk> isocitrate dehydrogenase activity but no <unk> isocitrate dehydrogenase activity .
the activities of most of these enzymes are increased during growth on glucose , alanine , glutamate or citrate , but only very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities are present under all growth conditions .
the restricted facultative <unk> grow on certain <unk> compounds in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and , in some cases , of other enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle ; these lesions can not therefore be the sole cause of obligate <unk> .
<unk> of stearic acid by liver and adipose tissue from <unk> mice ( <unk> ) .
stearic acid desaturase activity was assayed in preparations from <unk> adipose tissue and liver from lean and genetically obese female mice ( <unk> ) .
the total activity in the <unk> adipose tissue from obese mice was threefold greater than in the tissue from lean mice , but per g of adipose tissue the activity was twofold greater in tissue from lean mice .
in liver , the activity in obese mice was elevated at 8 weeks of age , remained elevated up to 24 weeks and then decreased by half at 48 weeks , but at all ages was higher than that in lean mice .
the decrease in desaturase activity of liver from obese mice at 48 weeks corresponded to a change in the fatty acid composition of liver lipids toward that found in lean mice .
whereas in adipose tissue much of the increased enzyme activity may be due to tissue hyperplasia , in liver it is mainly an increased activity per cell .
the stimulation by synaptic transmitters of the incorporation of <unk> into the phospholipid of synaptic membranes .
noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of <unk> into choline <unk> of <unk> brain synaptic membranes incubated in sodium phosphate buffer .
in the presence of 1 <unk> , noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of <unk> into the choline <unk> , phosphatidylinositol , ethanolamine <unk> , phosphatidylserine and <unk> acid of synaptic membranes incubated in 10 <unk> buffer .
in <unk> containing 1 <unk> , stimulation of incorporation of <unk> into choline <unk> by noradrenaline was enhanced by atp , <unk> , <unk> and coa plus <unk> .
the optimum concentration of <unk> for stimulation by 10 <unk> was 10 mum .
in the presence of <unk> , the optimum concentration of <unk> was in the range <unk> mm .
acetylcholine , <unk> , 5-hydroxytryptamine , dopamine , histamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid also stimulated the incorporation of <unk> into choline <unk> of synaptic membranes .
sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained , similar to those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase a2 ( <unk> & rowe , <unk> ) .
the initial rate of transfer of <unk> from <unk> to choline <unk> was similar to the initial rate of transfer from <unk> , stimulated by noradrenaline .
transfer of <unk> from <unk> was not appreciably stimulated by noradrenaline , but was stimulated by atp and <unk> .
the interaction of magnesium ions with <unk> acid .
the binding of <unk> to the wall <unk> acid of lactobacillus <unk> <unk> <unk> was measured by equilibrium dialysis at controlled ionic concentration and ph .
in an aqueous solution containing <unk> at ph 5.0 one <unk> ion was bound for every two phosphate groups of the <unk> acid , with an apparent association constant , <unk> .
= 2.7 x 10 ( 3 ) m-1 .
on lowering the ph below the pka of the phosphate groups the amount of bound <unk> decreased concomitantly with decreasing ionization of the phosphate groups .
both the amount of <unk> bound to the <unk> acid and the apparent association constants were similar in the presence of 10 mm concentrations of nacl or kcl but decreased markedly in the presence of 10 <unk> because of competition between <unk> and <unk> for the binding sites .
a similar effect was found when the concentration of nacl was increased from 0 to 50 mm .
the results are discussed in relation to the function of <unk> acid in the walls of gram-positive bacteria .
the mechanism of hydrolysis of <unk> by kidney alkaline phosphatase .
1. to identify the functional groups that are involved in the conversion of <unk> by alkaline phosphatase ( ec <unk> ) from pig kidney , the kinetics of alkaline phosphatase were investigated in the ph range <unk> at substrate concentrations of 3 <unk> mm .
from the plots of log <unk> against ph and log <unk> against ph one functional group with pk = 7.0 and two functional groups with pk = 9.1 were identified .
these groups are involved in substrate binding .
another group with pk = 8.8 was found , which in its <unk> form catalyses substrate conversion .
2. gsh inhibits the alkaline phosphatase reversibly and <unk> by attacking the bound zn ( ii ) .
3. the influence of the <unk> concentration on the activation by <unk> ions of alkaline pig kidney phosphate was investigated between ph 8.4 and 10.0 .
the binding of substrate and activating <unk> ions occurs independently at all ph values between 8.4 and 10.0 .
the activation mechanism is not affected by the <unk> concentration .
the <unk> ions are bound by a functional group with a pk of <unk> 4 .
a scheme is proposed for the reaction between enzyme , substrate , <unk> and <unk> and the overall rate equation is derived .
5. the mechanism of substrate binding and splitting by the functional groups of the active centre is discussed on the basis of a model .
<unk> seems to play a role as an <unk> effector .
the <unk> and group modification of beta-lactamase i .
the <unk> of the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by beta-lactamase i ( <unk> , ec <unk> ) was studied .
<unk> and ampicillin ( <unk> [ d ( - ) <unk> ] <unk> acid ) were used .
both <unk> and <unk> for both substrates gave bell-shaped plots of parameter versus ph .
the <unk> of <unk> for the two substrates gave the same value ( 8.6 ) for the higher apparent pk , and so this value may characterize a group on the free enzyme ; the lower apparent pk values were about 5 ( 4.85 for <unk> , 5.4 for ampicillin ) .
for <unk> both <unk> and <unk> depended on ph in exactly the same way .
the value of km for <unk> was thus independent of ph , suggesting that ionization of the <unk> catalytically important groups does not affect binding of this substrate .
the <unk> of <unk> for ampicillin differed , however , presumably because of the polar group in the side chain .
the hypothesis that the <unk> group is a carboxyl group was tested .
three reagents that normally react preferentially with carboxyl groups inactivated the enzyme : the reagents were <unk> reagent k , a water-soluble <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
these findings tend to support the idea that a carboxylate group plays a part in the action of beta-lactamase i .
<unk> enzymes of datura <unk> .
oxidation of <unk> acid ethyl ester .
an enzyme system from datura <unk> roots oxidizing <unk> acid ethyl ester was purified <unk> by conventional methods such as ( nh4 ) <unk> fractionation , negative adsorption on alumina cy gel and chromatography on <unk> .
the purified enzyme was shown to catalyse the <unk> oxidation of <unk> acid ethyl ester to <unk> acid ethyl ester and formic acid , utilizing molecular o2 .
substrate analogues such as <unk> and <unk> were oxidized at a very low rate , and <unk> was an <unk> agents , cyanide , thiol compounds and ascorbic acid .
this enzyme was identical with an <unk> isoenzyme .
another <unk> isoenzyme which separated on <unk> also showed <unk> acid ethyl ester oxidase activity , albeit to a lesser extent .
the properties of the two isoenzymes of the oxidase were compared and shown to differ in their oxidation and peroxidation properties .
the oxidation of <unk> acid ethyl ester was also catalysed by horseradish peroxidase .
the datura isoenzymes exhibited typical <unk> spectra .
the oxidation of <unk> acid ethyl ester was different from other <unk> reactions in not being activated by either <unk> or <unk> .
the oxidation was inhibited by several <unk> and <unk> and by catalase .
a reaction mechanism for the oxidation is proposed .
purification of <unk> dehydrogenase and its dependence on unusual amines .
1. <unk> dehydrogenase was purified from sheep liver and gave one band on <unk> electrophoresis .
2. the enzyme was completely dependent for its activity on the presence of tris or one of a number of related amines , all of general structure : ( see article ) .
when more than one r group was hydrogen no enzyme activity was observed .
3. only one of these amines is known to exist in living tissues and large concentrations of all amines were required for maximum activity .
<unk> was the most effective amine on the basis of substrate km and <unk> values and the amine km values .
<unk> the enzyme was activated by phosphate which lowered the km values for methylglyoxal , amine and <unk> .
5. the ph optimum of the enzyme was 9.3 and there was no activity at ph values below 7.8 .
a search for activators that might produce activity at ph 7.4 proved unsuccessful .
<unk> the enzyme was inhibited by rather large concentrations of barbiturates ( <unk> mm ) and <unk> analogues of the activating amines ( <unk> mm ) .
determination of <unk> ribonucleic acid in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of <unk> cells .
a number of parameters affecting the adsorption of rrna and poly ( a ) <unk> rna to millipore filters were investigated separately .
binding of both types of rna to the filter was dependent on the concentration of rna , ph and <unk> concentration of the reaction mixture .
both types of rna bound to the filter optimally at slightly acid ph values .
the binding of poly ( a ) <unk> rna to the filter exhibited a broad <unk> compared with that of rrna .
the ratio of poly ( a ) <unk> <unk> retained by the filter was maximal between <unk> and 8 .
the presence of 1 <unk> or a high concentration of nacl ( over <unk> ) decreased the affinity of rna for the filter .
the amount of poly ( a ) <unk> rna in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of a <unk> cell line ( <unk> ) labelled with [ 32p ] pi was determined by the <unk> technique under conditions that minimized contamination by rrna .
these data were compared with the estimations made by oligo ( dt ) <unk> chromatography .
the results obtained by these two methods were in good agreement for rna labelled for short periods ( up to 2h ) .
in long labelling and <unk> experiments , however , contamination of the filter by rrna of increasing specific radioactivity in the cytoplasm gave an erroneous value for poly ( a ) <unk> rna by the <unk> technique .
determinations made on the nuclear fraction by these two methods did not show significant variation in <unk> and long-term labelling experiments .
the amino acid sequence of neurospora <unk> glutamate dehydrogenase .
the <unk> peptides .
the <unk> glutamate dehydrogenase of neurospora crassa was digested with trypsin , and peptides accounting for 441 out of the 452 residues of the polypeptide chain were isolated and substantially sequenced .
additional experimental detail has been deposited as supplementary publication sup <unk> ( 11 pages ) with the british library ( lending division ) , boston spa , wetherby , w. yorkshire <unk> <unk> , u.k. , from whom copies may be obtained under the terms given in biochem j .
( 1975 ) 145 , 5 .
the amino acid sequence of neurospora <unk> glutamate dehydrogenase .
peptides from digestion with a staphylococcal proteinase .
the extracellular proteinase of staphylococcus aureus strain v8 was used to digest the <unk> glutamate dehydrogenase of neurospora crassa .
of 35 non-overlapping peptides expected from the glutamate content of the polypeptide chain , 29 were isolated and substantially sequenced .
the sequences obtained were valuable in providing overlaps for the alignment of about two-thirds of the sequences found in <unk> peptides [ wootton , j. c. , taylor , j , g. , jackson , a. a. , chambers , g. k. & fincham , j. r. s. ( 1975 ) <unk> j. 149 , <unk> ] .
the blocked n-terminal peptide of the protein was isolated .
this peptide was sequenced by mass spectrometry , and found to have n-terminal <unk> by howard r .
morris and anne dell , whose results are presented as an appendix to the main paper .
the staphylococcal proteinase showed very high specificity for <unk> bonds in the <unk> buffer used .
partial splits of two <unk> bonds , both <unk> , were probably attributable to the proteinase .
no cleavage of <unk> or <unk> bonds was found .
additional experimental detail has been deposited as supplementary publication sup <unk> ( 5 pages ) with the british library ( lending division ) , boston spa , wetherby , w. yorkshire <unk> <unk> , u.k , from whom copies may be obtained under the terms given in biochem .
j. ( 1975 ) 1458 5 .
the amino acid sequence of neurospora <unk> glutamate dehydrogenase .
peptic and <unk> peptides and the complete sequence .
peptic and <unk> peptides were isolated form the <unk> glutamate dehydrogenase of neurospora crassa and substantially sequenced .
out of 452 residues in the polypeptide chain , 265 were recovered in the peptic and 427 in the <unk> peptides .
together with the <unk> peptides [ wootton , j. c. , taylor , j. g. , jackson , a. a. , chambers , g. k. & fincham , j. r. s. ( 1975 ) <unk> j. 149 , <unk> ] , these establish the complete sequence of the chain , including the acid and amide assignments , except for seven places where overlaps are inadequate .
these remaining alignments are deduced from information on the <unk> fragments obtained in another laboratory [ blumenthal , k. m. , moon , k. & smith , e. l. ( 1975 ) , j. <unk> <unk> 250 , <unk> ] .
further information has been deposited as supplementary publication sup <unk> ( 17 pages ) with the british library ( lending division ) , boston spa , wetherby , w. yorkshire <unk> <unk> , u.k. , from whom copies may be obtained under the terms given in biochem .
j. ( 1975 ) 145 , 5 .
activities of citrate synthase , <unk> and <unk> isocitrate dehydrogenases , glutamate dehydrogenase , aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in nervous tissues from vertebrates and invertebrates .
1. the activities of citrate synthase and <unk> and <unk> isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured in nervous tissue from different animals in an attempt to provide more information about the citric acid cycle in this tissue .
in higher animals the activities of citrate synthase are greater than the sum of activities of the isocitrate dehydrogenases , whereas they are similar in nervous tissues from the lower animals .
this suggests that in higher animals the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is <unk> from equilibrium .
if it is assumed that isocitrate dehydrogenase activities provide an indication of the maximum flux through the citric acid cycle , the maximum glycolytic capacity in nervous tissue is considerably greater than that of the cycle .
this suggest that glycolysis can provide energy in excess of the aerobic capacity of the tissue .
2. the activities of glutamate dehydrogenase are high in most nervous tissues and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase are high in all nervous tissue investigated .
however , the activities of alanine aminotransferase are low in all tissues except the ganglia of the <unk> and cockroach .

properties of <unk> synthetase and its relationship to microsomal <unk> oxidation in the southern armyworm ( spodoptera eridania ) .
1. activity of <unk> synthetase was measured in the midgut and other tissues of the last larval instar of the southern armyworm ( spodoptera eridania cramer , formerly <unk> eridania cramer ) .
2. optimum conditions for measuring the activity were established with respect to all variables involved and considerable differences from those reported for mammalian enzyme preparations were found .
3. maximum activity ( 20 <unk> per mg of protein ) occurs 18-24 h after the fifth moult and thereafter decreases to trace amounts as the larvae age and approach pupation .
<unk> synthetase activity was rapidly induced by oral administration ( in the diet ) of <unk> , phenobarbital , diethyl <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
5. <unk> inhibited the induction of synthetase by <unk> .
<unk> induction of <unk> synthetase correlated well with the induction of microsomal <unk> of <unk> , except for phenobarbital , which induced the microsomal oxidase relatively more than the synthetase .

formation of <unk> as an unstable product of the <unk> in dilute <unk> solution .
reaction of phenacetin with <unk> in glacial acetic acid at 10 ( 0 ) c gives <unk> .
this <unk> is stable at low temperatures ( -- 30 degress c ) but unstable at ambient temperature .
no intact <unk> can be detected when phenacetin is <unk> under conditions simulating those in the stomach ( 37 degrees c , ph 1 ) .
instead , <unk> chloride is the main reaction product found .
under the conditions applied , the <unk> rapidly rearranges by <unk> of the acetyl group .
the resulting <unk> dissociates into the corresponding diazonium salt .
trapping of the diazonium ion with <unk> as an azo dye provides a useful means to identify the parent <unk> compound and to measure <unk> its rate of formation .
the yields obtained in dilute aqueous <unk> mixtures are lower than expected ; the reasons for this finding are discussed .
preliminary results of animal experiments show that the <unk> compound is a directly acting carcinogen .
[ thermographic and histologic studies of the antiinflammatory effect of <unk> by means of the cotton pellet test in the rat ( <unk> transl ) ] .
1. the effect of ( <unk> ) <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) on the inflammatory process was studied <unk> and histologically in <unk> tests on rats .
2. following implantation of the <unk> , thermography shows a clear inhibition of the local inflammation due to treatment with <unk> .
3. histological examination shows a corresponding influence of <unk> upon the proliferative phase of the inflammation .
<unk> the success of <unk> therapy is in correlation with the time of medication .
acidic antiinflammatory agents -- correlations of some physical , pharmacological and clinical data .
fifteen acidic antiinflammatory agents , for which some clinical data have previously been published , have been examined for their potency in the <unk> rat foot edema test , and for their acidity ( pka ) and partition coefficients .
published serum half-life data and daily clinical ( <unk> ) dose have been tabulated for these drugs and correlations between these various parameters are discussed .
the rat foot edema carrageenan test has proved to be a fairly reliable predictor of clinical dose for most acidic antiinflammatory agents of moderate serum half-life .
[ clinical trial of a novel benzodiazepine derivative in a double-blind study using the wittenborn psychiatric rating scale ( <unk> transl ) ] .
from testing a new benzodiazepine derivative , <unk> ( bu 1014 ) , as measured against a placebo in a double-blind trial , the following conclusions can be drawn .
the test was carried out over two periods of a fortnight each with a change-over between the two periods .
1. the change-over method has proven suitable to reveal side effects of the substance which last for at least two weeks .
owing to the <unk> sequelae , however , statistical analysis of the second treatment <unk> information is not possible with this experimental design .
2. the statistical methods used proved more effective than the usual methods as they allow clearer statements to be made on the efficacy of the substance .
3. within the first period of 14 days both the group receiving the placebo and the drug treated group showed a decrease in the intensity of anxiety .
<unk> the sequelae of bu 1014 can be described as an increase in restiveness and anxiety in those patients who received the placebo in the second treatment period .

<unk> and <unk> acid .
assay methods in blood and urine , <unk> cells repartition and stability .
the following assay methods for pharmacokinetic studies on <unk> ( f ) and on its main metabolite , i.e. <unk> acid ( a ) , are described .
1. spectrophotometry for the assay of f and of a in plasma , 2. <unk> and glc for the assay of a in urine after acid hydrolysis , 3. <unk> for determining the f : a ratio in plasma or in urine .
it was found that f hydrolyzes into a .
this process depends on the ph and on the medium .
in water , at ph 5.0 , f is stable , while in phosphate buffer at ph 7.4 the <unk> time is 60 min .
in a solution with bovine serum albumin , in rat , rabbit , dog or human plasma the <unk> times are between 5 and 60 min .
finally the <unk> cells <unk> of f and of a were studied in vitro in rat , rabbit , dog and human blood and found between 0.8 and 2.0 for f and between 2.1 and 4.6 for a .
[ on the pharmacology of <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( wa 335 ) , a histamine and serotonin antagonist ( <unk> transl ) ] .
the substance <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( wa 335 ) was examined for its antagonistic effects against histamine and serotonin , for its <unk> properties as well as for a series of other qualities in comparison with <unk> and <unk> .
the <unk> and <unk> activities of compound wa 335 on the smooth muscle and the capillary do not only exceed that of <unk> but also that of <unk> .
wa 335 shows an extremely strong binding to histamine and serotonin receptors .
in the dose range in which it causes already an <unk> effect , its oral absorption is very good .
the <unk> effect is much stronger than that of <unk> .
like <unk> and <unk> , wa 335 has no distinct antagonistic qualities against bradykinin .
the anticholinergic effects of wa 335 are dependent on the test object .
in examinations on the bronchus of the guinea pig and the pupil of the mouse , the <unk> efficiency corresponds to that of <unk> ; it is stronger on the stimulated vagus of the cat and less efficient than <unk> on the stomach of the rat .
wa 335 has distinct central <unk> properties .
it possesses a strong surface anesthetic activity .
the effects of wa 335 on circulation are dependent on species .
in contrast to <unk> , compound wa 335 like <unk> potentiates the effects of norepinephrine in cats .
the reduction of the carotid sinus reflex in the cat is more distinct after wa 335 than after <unk> and corresponds to that produced by <unk> .
higher doses of wa 335 than are necessary to demonstrate <unk> effects are needed to provoke central nervous effects .
wa 335 shows no analgesic potency in mice .
the influence on body temperature in the rat is similar to that of <unk> .
wa 335 is equally efficient as <unk> with regard to the inhibition of spontaneous motility and prolongation of barbiturate sleep in mice , and shows the same <unk> activity as does chlorpromazine in dogs .
in contrast to chlorpromazine the behaviour of dogs and cats is distinctly altered already by doses of wa 335 which cause a slight sedation .
[ central action of <unk> , a substance with peripheral <unk> and <unk> activity ] .
in rats and mice the serotonin and histamine antagonistic drug <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( wa <unk> ) caused stronger central sedative effects than did <unk> .
wa <unk> also displayed stronger activity against <unk> and central <unk> effects than did <unk> and it slightly enhanced <unk> effects : therefore it may have antidepressant properties .
wa <unk> proved to be very effective against <unk> aggression in male mice .
the comparatively small anxiolytic effects may have been caused in part by the central <unk> properties .
like <unk> , wa <unk> increased food consumption in cats .
in <unk> in the conscious rabbit the <unk> drugs wa <unk> and <unk> exerted stronger depressant activity on the arousal reactions than did the neuroleptic chlorpromazine .
the results of our animal studies suggest wa <unk> to be an antidepressant with sedative properties .
the distribution and elimination of radioactivity in the rat after administration of <unk> ( <unk> ) .
following oral administration of <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) to rats , no gross differences were detected 7.5 h after administration with respect to the distribution of 14c in various tissues , including the upper sections of the small intestine .
a high concentration of 14c was found in the lower sections of the intestine 4 h after administration .
the 14c in the intestine was present as unchanged <unk> , as detected by <unk> chromatography , suggesting that <unk> absorption was slow .
intravenous injection of <unk> to rats showed that the drug had a relatively high elimination rate from the blood with a half-life of 1.9 h .
in blood <unk> must be rapidly hydrolysed enzymatically since no <unk> , other than salicylic acid , could be detected .
comparative studies of <unk> drugs on stomach ( double blind test ) and analysis of relation between gastric form and tonus .
effects of 3 kinds of <unk> drugs ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) and placebo ( physiological saline solution ) on the gastrointestinal tract were evaluated <unk> by double blind technique in a total of 101 male human subjects .
the results may briefly be summarized as follows : 1. there were significant differences on hypotonic rate being one of the indexes of the gastric tonus between <unk> and placebo .
the effects of 3 experimental drugs were significantly high as compared with that of placebo on peristaltic movement of the stomach .
the effect of <unk> was significantly different from that of placebo on the site of arrival of barium .
2. the comparison of degrees of the gastric tonus between main and control tests revealed that the effect of placebo obtained in the main test was significantly inferior to that of <unk> obtained in the control test , whereas there existed no significant differences of the effects among 3 active drugs .
3. effects of each drug on the gastric tonus which was scored by hypertonic , <unk> and hypotonic state were evaluated by stratification .
the result showed that the effect of <unk> was significantly greater than that of placebo .
<unk> all active drugs were not significantly different in terms of 7 observed values each on the gastric form .
[ treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with fungal lipase ( <unk> transl ) ] .
7 patients suffering from severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency have been treated with a <unk> enzyme extracted from rhizopus <unk> .
comparing the fungal lipase with a placebo the drug lowered the daily stool weight from 809 g to 443 g on an average , i.e. by 45.2 % .
the <unk> was reduced from 75.6 <unk> h to 32.9 g , i.e. by 56.5 % .
when incubating the enzyme in vitro in saline solutions of different ph for 1 h the loss of <unk> activity is 13 % at ph 5 , 15 % at ph 4 , and 19 % at ph 3 .
so the enzyme , like fungal proteases , is almost not altered by hydrochloric acid at concentrations found physiologically in the stomach .
study of the sporulation of bacillus thuringiensis <unk> thuringiensis .
during the submerged cultivation of bacillus thuringiensis <unk> thuringiensis in <unk> and <unk> <unk> , lysis occurred at the end of the exponential phase of growth .
new vegetative cells were subsequently formed which usually <unk> .
at time of lysis , the amount of soluble sugar was 1-12 <unk> , ph value dropped to <unk> from the original ph 6.8 and started to rise after all the cells had lysed .
the proteolytic activity was low during the lysis and increased as the sporulation commenced .

some observations on the effects produced in white mice following the injection of certain suspensions of corroding bacilli .
strictly anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic strains of `` corroding bacilli '' failed to produce any pathological symptoms when injected into white mice and no viable organisms could be recovered after 7 days .
however , when these same strains were coupled with certain other living bacteria or certain sterile bacterial extracts , lesions developed from which corroding bacilli could be isolated even after 21 days .
lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis .
3. peptide hydrolases .
four distinct peptide hydrolases ( ec 3-4 ) have been characterized in <unk> epidermis ; these are cathepsin b1 , cathepsin c , cathepsin d and <unk> .
their properties are consistent with those of lysosomal enzymes .
cathepsin e was not detected .
micellar <unk> of fatty acids in aqueous media containing bile salts and phospholipids .
1. the solubility of fatty acids in aqueous media containing bile salts alone and in admixture with either lecithin ( phosphatidylcholine ) or phosphatidylethanolamine was determined .
2. over the ph range <unk> , the order of fatty acid solubility in aqueous solutions containing bile salts was linoleic greater than oleic greater than <unk> greater than palmitic greater than stearic .
the solubility of each fatty acid increased as the ph of the <unk> solutions of bile salts greatly increased the solubility of palmitic acid and stearic acid .
<unk> in the presence of bile salts and lecithin , the solubility of oleic acid and <unk> acid decreased with increasing ph of the micellar solution , indicating a competitive effect between the fatty acid anions and lecithin .
the solubility of linoleic acid increased linearly with lecithin concentration .
5. phosphatidylethanolamine as an additive to bile salts increased the solubility of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the ph range <unk> .
the effectiveness of phosphatidylethanolamine as an <unk> was similar to that of lecithin , although at ph 3.0 fatty acid solubility was greater in the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine .
<unk> the significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the intestinal absorption of fatty acids in sheep .
influence of the products of <unk> of phosphatidylcholine on micellar <unk> of fatty acids in the presence of bile salts .
1. the solubility of fatty acids in aqueous solutions containing bile salts and <unk> at ph values between 2-0 and 7-4 was studied .
both the <unk> and <unk> isomers of <unk> increased the solubility of fatty acids to the same extent , the order of solubility being linoleic greater than oleic greater than <unk> greater than palmitic greater than stearic .
2. the influence of the products of <unk> of lecithin on palmitic acid solubility was determined .
on a molar basis , <unk> was more effective than were bile salts in promoting the <unk> of the fatty acid .
3. in bile salt solutions in which the phospholipid concentration was constant on a molar basis , in solubility of palmitic acid decreased linearly with the progressive replacement of lecithin by <unk> .
palmitic acid was <unk> to the same extent on replacing lecithin with <unk> on a constant weight basis .
<unk> in bile salt solution containing <unk> and oleic acid in <unk> amounts , the solubility of palmitic acid was similar to that in bile salt solution containing lecithin in equivalent proportion .
5. the results are discussed in relation to the action of <unk> activity on the intestinal absorption of fatty acids in sheep .
the purification and characterization of the low molecular weight human folate binding protein using affinity chromatography .
the low molecular weight folate binding protein ( <unk> ) has been purified <unk> to a specific activity of 7.2 gamma g of <unk> acid ( pga ) bound per mg of protein .
this purified <unk> represents two protein bands that bind pga on polyacrylamide disc gel <unk> , <unk> from <unk> in 0.001 m phosphate buffer , stains positive with pas , <unk> from <unk> a <unk> affinity columns with methyl <unk> , and shows three major peaks ( pl <unk> , 7.5 , 8.2 ) by <unk> focusing .

studies on iga and iga monoclonal proteins derived from a single patient .
evidence for identical light chains and variable regions of the heavy chain .
two immunoglobulins , iga ( k ) and igg ( k ) , were isolated from the serum of a single patient with two monoclonal components ( <unk> proteins ) .
after chain separation , the light chains from each molecule were found to be identical by the following criteria : electrophoretic mobilities under various ph and dissociating conditions , amino acid <unk> , fingerprint analysis of <unk> peptides and of <unk> <unk> peptides , and amino acid sequence of the n-terminal 40 residues .
the heavy chains were indistinguishable for the n-terminal 45 amino acid residues .
these data are consistent with the hypothesis that a single heavy chain variable ( vh ) region may be associated with two different heavy chain constant ( ch ) genes .
conformational properties of bovine plasma albumin with a cleaved internal peptide bond .
as shown previously , proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the f conformational state near ph 3.7 .
the primary proteolytic product , bpa , has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately <unk> and <unk> on reduction .
evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between <unk> and <unk> with no detectable loss of small peptides , the amino acid composition of bpa being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error .
cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the <unk> bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another <unk> bond in the <unk> region of residues <unk> .
the damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements , probably an approximate 15 % loss in helicity .
the hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20 % .
however , various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein .
of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the <unk> and <unk> transitions , although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate ph than in the parent protein .
moreover a sensitivity of the <unk> transition to <unk> is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye <unk> acid is essentially unaltered .
the results are best understood in terms of the concept of a <unk> structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma <unk> .
bond cleavage damages one domain but leaves the overall structure essentially unaltered except for some weakening of the interaction between domains .
detection and partial characterization of lipoprotein lipase in bovine aorta .
extracts of <unk> powders of bovine thoracic aorta contain lipase activity which has an alkaline ph maximum ( <unk> ) and is stimulated <unk> by adding serum or isolated <unk> to the assay mixture .
serum activation is completely reversed by isolated <unk> or <unk> .
lipolysis is strongly inhibited by nacl ( 0.5 m ) and <unk> sulfate ( 1 mg/ml ) and partially inhibited by heparin .
based on these characteristics , the lipase is identified as lipoprotein lipase .

the enzyme synthesizes purine nucleoside <unk> ( mono , di , or tri ) <unk> such as <unk> , <unk> , papp , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> by transferring a <unk> group from the <unk> of atp , <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of purine nucleotides .
the purified enzyme catalysed the formation of 435 <unk> of <unk> and 620 <unk> of <unk> from atp and gtp per min mg protein under the standard conditions .
the enzyme requires absolutely a divalent cation for activity , and optimum ph for the enzyme activity lay above 10 for <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> from 9 to 9.5 , and for <unk> from 7.5 to 8 .
the following michaelis constants were determined : amp , 2.78 mm ; adp , 3.23 mm ; gmp , 0.89 mm ; gdp , 0.46 mm and gtp , 1.54 mm , in the case of atp donor .

the enzyme was found to have a molecular weight of 203 000 , a frictional ratio of 1.6 and an isoelectric point of approximately 5 .
michaelis constants for atp and <unk> were 0.11 mm and 0.12 mm , respectively .
phospholipase a2 isoenzyme from porcine pancreas .
purification and some properties .
porcine pancreas synthesizes a <unk> a2 which occurs in a 5 : 95 ratio compared with the more abundant zymogen of the same enzyme ( <unk> ; ec <unk> ) .
these two <unk> could be well separated by <unk> chromatography .
both the active and the zymogen form of the isoenzyme were isolated and purified .
the activation peptides of both <unk> appeared to be identical , while the active enzymes showed a few interesting differences .
the most striking differences were the loss of one histidine and one methionine in the isoenzyme , corresponding to residues 24 and 27 , respectively , in <unk> a2 .
the positional and stereo specificity of both enzymes are the same , but the specific activity of the <unk> a2 is lower .
the molecular weight of the isoenzyme was estimated to be about 14 000 , while the isoelectric points were 5.1 and 5.9 for the <unk> and active isoenzyme , respectively .
<unk> nucleotide phosphodiesterase in silkworm .
characterization of cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase .
the existence of cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase ( ec <unk> ) was demonstrated in silkworm larva by gel filtration of the <unk> .

the enzyme has a molecular weight of <unk> 260 000 , and optimum ph of 8.3 and a km value of 2 mum .
the enzyme is activated by 5 mm of <unk> and 2 mm of <unk> .
the cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase activity was greatly inhibited by low concentrations of cyclic imp but to a lesser extent by cyclic amp even at a high concentration .
the activity was also inhibited by caffeine and theophylline .
<unk> in schizosaccharomyces .
isolation and properties of an <unk> from the cell extracts and culture fluid of schizosaccharomyces japonicus <unk> <unk> .
( 11 cell extracts and extracellular culture fluids of species of the yeast genus schizosaccharomyces exhibited <unk> ( 1 leads to 3 ) - and <unk> ( 1 leads to 6 ) <unk> ( ec <unk> ) activities .
( 2 ) using a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> chromatography , the <unk> ( 1 leads to 3 ) <unk> from the cell extracts and culture fluid of schizosaccharomyces japonicus <unk> <unk> were purified extensively .
the enzymes from either location exhibited similar purification and other properties .
( 3 ) the purified enzymes hydrolysed the <unk> ( 1 leads to 6 ) <unk> linkage in addition to the <unk> ( 1 leads to 3 ) linkage .
heat denaturation , inhibition and electrophoretic studies indicated that both hydrolytic activities were properties of a single protein .
<unk> and <unk> hydrolysis followed michaelis-menten kinetics .
the km and v for <unk> hydrolysis were 6.25 mg/ml and 350 <unk> of glucose <unk> protein , and for <unk> they were 166 mg/ml and 52 <unk> of glucose <unk> protein .
( 4 ) the <unk> was assigned a molecular weight of 43 000 .
( 5 ) the purified enzyme failed to hydrolyse isolated cell walls from either <unk> yeast or schizosaccharomyces pombe or to induce <unk> formation from intact cells of s. japonicus <unk> <unk> or saccharomyces cerevisiae .
purification and some properties of a novel <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> producing amylase ( ec <unk> ) is the fourth known <unk> , the three previously known being <unk> , <unk> and pseudomonas <unk> <unk> producing amylase .
the enzyme after release from <unk> <unk> cells by 0.1 % sodium lauryl sulfate extraction was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation , <unk> column chromatography and <unk> <unk> gel filtration to <unk> of the original sodium lauryl sulfate extract activity , it gave a single band on disc electrophoresis , and the molecular weight by gel filtration was 54 000 .
this amylase showed maximal activity at 50 degrees c and ph 6.80 .
the ph stability range was relatively wide , the enzyme retaining more than 90 % of its initial activity in the range of <unk> 80 % of the activity was retained after 15 min at 50 degrees c .
this enzyme produced <unk> from starch , amylose and amylopectin by <unk> , but did not act on <unk> or <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
also the enzyme acted on <unk> <unk> of amylopectin and glycogen to form branched oligosaccharides .
the unusual reaction of this enzyme on <unk> dextrin is discussed from the standpoint of the stereochemistry of <unk> and <unk> bonds .
this is the anomalous amylase for which it is recognized that <unk> linkages in the substrates can mimic the effect of <unk> , as previously observed in <unk> reactions of e. coli phosphorylase .
inhibition of human liver <unk> and <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> is an irreversible inhibitor of the <unk> ' and the <unk> ' <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , ec <unk> ) of human liver .
the inactivation of acid beta-galactosidase appears to involve a group with a pka = 4.5 .
the inhibition of neutral beta-galactosidase only occurs above ph 8.0 .
both enzymes are protected against inhibition by the presence of substrates , suggesting that the inhibitor reacts with the active site of the enzymes .
other lysosomal hydrolases are not inhibited by <unk> , with the exception of <unk> ' <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , ec <unk> ) .
the ph dependence of neutral <unk> inactivation is essentially identical to that of the neutral beta-galactosidase .
inhibition of <unk> by this galactose derivative suggests that the same enzyme may bind glucosides and <unk> .
furthermore , both neutral beta-galactosidase and <unk> are inactivated at 52 degrees c with a half-life of 7.5 min .
the presence of a single enzyme with both <unk> and beta-galactosidase activities is also supported by <unk> experiments .
<unk> from bacillus subtilis <unk> .
an <unk> was purified from the culture fluid of bacillus subtilis <unk> .
the process was as follows : salting out by ( nh4 ) <unk> , repeated chromatography on hydroxy apatite and gel filtration on <unk> .
the purified enzyme was demonstrated to be homogeneous by disc electrophoresis .
the enzyme was found to be active on <unk> and <unk> , but inactive on phenyl <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , gum arabic .
the enzyme released arabinose , <unk> , <unk> and higher oligosaccharides during the course of hydrolysis of <unk> .
the end products were found to be arabinose and <unk> after 144 h of hydrolysis .

properties and specificities of the enzymes of intermediate electrophoretic mobility .
the major group of <unk> ( ec <unk> ) of intermediate electrophoretic mobility , from <unk> <unk> larvae , hav been fractionated into six bands by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the properties of these fractions investigated .
they resemble each other in their ph optima of 8.2 , their molecular weight of 240 000 , their responses to various active site inhibitors and metal cations , and their specificities towards seventeen <unk> substrates .
the derivatives of methionine , leucine , alanine , lysine , arginine and glutamic acid were those most rapidly hydrolysed .
they appear to be true <unk> <unk> amino acid amides , dipeptides and <unk> from the n-terminal end .
studies on an activator of the ( <unk> plus <unk> ) <unk> of human erythrocyte membranes .
1. an activator of the ( <unk> plus <unk> ) <unk> atpase present in the human erythrocytes ( membrane ) has been isolated in soluble form from <unk> of these cells .
partial purification has been achieved through use of <unk> chromatography .
the resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3 % of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell .
2. whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 <unk> buffer at ph 7.6 or at ph 5.8 , only the membranes prepared at ph 7.6 were affected by it .
2. whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 <unk> buffer at ph 7.6 or at ph 5.8 , only the membranes prepared at ph 7.6 were affected by it .
3. when ( <unk> plus <unk> ) <unk> activity was measured by <unk> release from ( <unk> ) atp , <unk> erythrocytes , as well as membranes prepared at ph 5.8 and at ph 7.6 , expressed lower values than noted by assay for total pi release .
when adp instead of atp was used as substrate , significant amount of pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations .
further study revealed ( a ) production of atp and amp from adp with membranes and <unk> alone , and ( b ) exchange of the <unk> <unk> phosphate on ( <unk> ) atp in the presence of membranes plus <unk> .
these observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the ( <unk> ) <unk> and in membranes .
it further supports the conclusion that pi release from adp by human erythrocytes ( <unk> ) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of atp by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated atp by ( <unk> plus <unk> ) <unk> .
<unk> the following points were also established : ( a ) absence of an <unk> in human erythrocytes ; ( b ) the ( <unk> plus <unk> ) <unk> activator enhanced cleavage only of the <unk> of atp and ( c ) the ( <unk> plus <unk> ) <unk> activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin .

optical and esr spectra of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase <unk> with acid and alkali are described .
sharp changes in activity and spectra were found .
`` residual '' activity of alkaline <unk> protein was higher than of acidic <unk> sample .
it is suggested that covalent bonding <unk> is essential for superoxide dismutase activity of the protein or synthetic copper complexes .

after cell damage n increases .
dependence of n correlates with the increase of some injured cells determined by <unk> test .

[ the fragmentation and reconstruction of the <unk> atpase system of liver mitochondria ] .
the protein and <unk> complexes and <unk> insensitive soluble atpase were prepared from rat liver mitochondria .
the incubation of soluble atpase with protein and <unk> complexes resulted in restoration of atpase sensitivity to <unk> at room temperature .
the process of reconstruction depended on ph , incubation time , temperature and other conditions .

<unk> was isolated from cells of st. aureus <unk> .
the method of isolation and partial purification of the enzyme is worked out .
km values of the enzyme for acetate , coa and atp are calculated .

the enzyme activity is estimated depending on the age of the cell culture and on the presence of acetate in the culture medium .
[ effect of prosthetic group of horseradish peroxidase on enzyme stability ] .
constants of inactivation rate of horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) <unk> and <unk> ( pp ) are estimated at the ph range <unk> and 25 degrees c .
two <unk> groups ( acid and alkaline ) are detected on cases of hrp and <unk> , which are responsible for stable hrp conformation .
hrp stability within the ph range 5-10 exceeded 30 times that of <unk> , while the stability <unk> complex is similar to that of <unk> .
the data obtained show that formation of complex of <unk> with pp , an analogue of the <unk> group lacking central fe atom , practically does not affect the stability of hrp protein <unk> at ph 5-10 , but significantly <unk> <unk> at the extreme ph values .
the complex formation of <unk> with active prosthetic group - hemin - results on the stable conformation of the hrp protein <unk> , which suggests a determining role of fe ion - porphyrin complex ( hemin ) on the support of the stable hrp structure .
[ wheat protein disulfide reductase ] .
<unk> reductase is isolated and partially purified from wheat seedlings and some properties of the enzyme are studied : ph optimum is 7.4 ; temperature optimum - 37 degrees c ; km = <unk> ( -4 ) m for the substrate ( wheat albumin ) ; km = <unk> ( -5 ) m for coenzyme ( <unk> ) .
the enzyme is specific for <unk> and is not active in the presence of <unk> .
maximal activity of <unk> reductase is developed in anaerobic conditions .
a technique of the estimation of <unk> reductase activity using wheat albumin as a substrate is worked out .
the enzyme activity decreases regularly in the corn ripening and increases under germination .
it is accompanied by the respective increase or decrease in the amount of disulphide bonds in gluten protein and by changes of physico-chemical characteristics of gluten .
incubation of gluten with the enzyme preparation affects <unk> properties of gluten ( it becomes weaker ) and decreases the gluten viscosity of gluten solution .
[ modification of pancreatic ribonuclease activity in complexes with <unk> ] .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> sulfate interact with pancreatic ribonuclease .
in comparison with ribonuclease activity the activity of formed complexes changes differently at the stages of transesterification and hydrolysis , and at each stage the effect of polymers on ribonuclease activity essentially differs .
the use of <unk> sulfate complex in the reaction of <unk> ( 3 ' leads to 5 ' ) <unk> synthesis demonstrated that the protein synthetic activity completely retained when hydrolytic activity was considerably suppressed .
[ kinetics and mechanism of action of horseradish peroxidase in the reaction of <unk> acid oxidation with atmospheric oxygen ] .
quantitative kinetic data are given on the oxidation reaction of <unk> acid ( dfa ) with atmospheric oxygen in the presence of horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) depending on ph .
activation constants of oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and mn ions are determined at ph 3.0 .
autocatalytic character of fra oxidation is shown to be due to the formation of h2o2 and other hydro <unk> compounds in the reaction , hrp <unk> in the dfa -- o2 system are studied using spectrophotometry .
a mechanism of the initiation of free radicals in hrp -- dfa -- o2 system is proposed .
[ some physical and chemical properties of <unk> from chicken liver ] .
an improved procedure of purification of <unk> from chicken liver is described .
preparations of enzyme ( <unk> purification with the yield of 40 per cent from total activity ) have been obtained homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
molecular weight of <unk> is <unk> ; 1 mole of enzyme contains 2 moles of <unk> and consists apparently of 2 subunits .
amino acid composition of the enzyme is studied .
absorption spectrum of <unk> has a maximum at 430 nm what is characteristic of numerous <unk> enzymes .
the position of this maximum does not depend on ph ( within its range 6 -- 10 ) and the presence of l-serine , a primary enzyme substrate .
an essential change in the absorption spectrum of enzyme was observed in the presence of some thiol compound -- <unk> , <unk> and glutathione ( <unk> of the reaction ) and l-cysteine ( a primary reaction substrate ) .
it is suggested that this change in the spectrum is due to the action of <unk> on the enzyme conformation before the beginning of the enzymatic reaction or on its initial stages .
[ specificity of extracellular alkaline <unk> from penicillium <unk> <unk> ] .
specificity of <unk> homogenous extracellular alkaline <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> on rna , synthetic <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is studied .
the enzyme is found to release from rna <unk> and <unk> only .
<unk> acid is a <unk> nucleotide of oligonucleotides of different length .
the enzyme readily hydrolyses <unk> and practically do not splits <unk> .
<unk> is demonstrated to be a good substrate for the rnase , while g greater than p hydrolyses with a low rate .
the <unk> catalyses the synthesis of gpc ( 47.7 per cent yield ) and gpu ( 38.8 per cent yield ) .
thus , the <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> is considered to be <unk> .
[ intermediate plateaux in kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by <unk> <unk> dehydratase from escherichia coli ] .
it has been shown that for the reaction catalyzed by `` <unk> '' <unk> dehydratase from e. coli strains k-12 and 980 in 0.5 m <unk> buffer , ph 8.4 and ph 9.5 , the plots of initial reaction rate ( v ) versus the initial substrate concentration ( [ s ] 0 are characterized by several inflection points , i. e. an intermediate plateau .
the plot of v versus the allosteric activator ( amp ) concentration have very complicated shapes : there are several inflection points , and also the maximum at <unk> concentration equal to 3-10 ( 2 ) and 5-10 ( -2 ) m .
high amp concentrations inhibit the enzyme at high substrate concentrations .
the reduced <unk> dose not influence the enzyme and does not alter the activating effect of amp .
on the basis of the data obtained it is proposed that the substrate and amp shift the equilibrium between multiple oligomeric enzyme forms differing in catalytic activity and kinetic manifestations of allosteric interactions between the active and allosteric <unk> sites towards polymerization .
thus , the functioning the enzyme under study is discussed in the frames of the model of dissociating regulatory enzymes with multiple intermediate oligomeric forms .
[ isoenzymes of phosphorylase from skeletal muscles of <unk> and <unk> fish ] .
separation and partial purification of isoenzymes of phosphorylase b from skeletal muscles of lamprey ( <unk> ) and carp ( cyprinus carpio ) was carried out .
isoenzyme i was adsorbed on <unk> cellulose and eluted by kcl ; isoenzyme ii was not adsorbed on <unk> cellulose .
a number of kinetic characteristics of phosphorylase of the coldblooded were determined , e. g .
km values for glucose-1-phosphate , glycogen and amp ; ki for glucose-6-phosphate ; stability towards denaturation ( heating and effect of urea ) and ph optimum .
it was observed that in the course of evolution of vertebrates the km values for substrates and allosteric activator ( amp ) , as well as the inhibition by glucose-6-phosphate showed a decrease .
isoenzymes i and ii of phosphorylase b were found non-identical with respect to some molecular characteristics , in carp the differences being far more pronounced than in lamprey .
[ multiple forms of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase revealed by means of specific elution ] .
the modified procedure for rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase ( pfk ) purification is worked out <unk> the method of specific elution from <unk> in 0.1 m <unk> ph 8.0 with 10 mm citrate .
by the latter procedure pfk can be resolved into fractions a , b and c which are eluted specifically , with 0.3 m buffer and with 1.5 m nacl respectively .
<unk> of each fraction reveals their <unk> .
the preparations are characterized by disc electrophoresis and velocity sedimentation .
the results of <unk> experiments demonstrate that high concentrations of formaldehyde dissociate pfk u to the 5.3 s component .
the presence of the 19.3 s component in the <unk> preparations evidences against the possibility that the middle component , presented at the schlieren patterns of pfk at ph 8.0 , is and artifact of superposition .
complex profiles of protein distribution observed in different transport experiments are discussed from the point of view of slow equilibrium of oligomers and conformers characteristic to pfk over the ph range from 6 to 9 .
[ flourescent properties of histidine decarboxylase from micrococcus sp. n ] .
a dependency of fluorescence parameters of <unk> ( hdc ) from <unk> sp. n. on ph values is studied .
native hds has a <unk> maximum position ( 325 nm ) and a small half-width of the fluorescence spectrum ( <unk> ) .
the change in the quantum yield of the enzyme fluorescence was parallel with the change of the enzymatic activity .
<unk> residues of native hdc are located at hydrophobic region of the enzyme <unk> .
the dependency of hdc <unk> parameters on ph values in 8 m urea was similar to that of free <unk> .
a comparative study of <unk> parameters of hdc and its inhibitory complexes with methyl ester of histidine ( meh ) , hydroxylamine and <unk> is carried out .
the effect of hdc interacting with inhibitors on fluorescence parameters of the enzyme is discussed .
no differences were found in infra-red spectra of hdc and its inhibitory complex with meh .
[ activity of polynucleotide phosphorylase in ribosomal fraction of rat liver ] .
a method of isolating <unk> ( <unk> ) containing <unk> fraction from rat liver is described .
<unk> is found to be bind to rna in <unk> with weak electrostatic bonds which are easily broken down in a weak alkaline medium with ionic strength more than 0.1 <unk> adp , gdp , udp and cdp are found among the products of endogenous rna degradation in the fraction of total <unk> in the presence of <unk> .
a considerable change in the base composition of <unk> rna is observed at different incubation times of total <unk> with <unk> : <unk> ratio increased from 2.3 to 3.1 , and <unk> <unk> 0.47 to 1.06 with the increase of the incubation time .
specific activity of pnp in ribosome fractions obtained under <unk> of total <unk> in <unk> density gradient ( <unk> m ) increased in the direction from the fraction of heavy <unk> to trimers and dimers and then dropped at the region of monomers ( 80 s particles ) .
the data obtained give no possibility to determine the type of <unk> rna in <unk> of rat liver .
[ the effect of <unk> substrates and atp on the sensitivity of certain <unk> functions <unk> particles to <unk> a , c and d ] .
the effect of nadh , succinate and atp on the sensitivity of a number of <unk> functions of <unk> particles ot <unk> a , c and d has been studied .
it has been shown that in the conditions of oxidation of nadh and succinate by oxygen and also of atp hydrolysis , the decrease in the phosphorylating activity of the particles under the action of <unk> c and d accelerates .
no such acceleration has been observed with phospholipase a .
for other two functions , i. e. reverse electron transfer ( atp-dependent <unk> reduction by succinate ) and atp-dependent transhydrogenase reaction the results proved to be different .
<unk> substrates and atp promoted the maintenance of these functions in the presence of phospholipase a , but did not retard their suppression by <unk> c and d .
the effects of nadh , succinate and atp on the sensitivity of different <unk> functions of <unk> particles to <unk> a , c and d could be removed by the uncoupling agent carbonyl <unk> hydrazone .
the conclusion is made that the effects revealed are associated with an increase in the sensitivity of coupling sites ii <unk> iii to <unk> c and d and with a decrease in the sensitivity of sites i and iv to phospholipase a on <unk> of <unk> particles .

a model for the origin of stable <unk> in a primitive alkaline ocean .
when a mixture of the eighteen <unk> amino acids are suitably heated in the dry state with seawater salts , a <unk> acid results .
one fraction of this polymer is found , through isoelectric focusing , to consist of a mixture of acidic and basic <unk> , each of sharply limited heterogeneity .
when one fraction of the seawater <unk> is dissolved in hot water , and the solution is cooled , <unk> microspheres result .
these have properties in common with simpler types , but also stable at ph values to 9 , in common with microspheres prepared by mixing acidic and basic <unk> .
these processes thus constitute a simple model for the origin of a <unk> stable in a primitive alkaline ocean .
hypothesis on the role of <unk> states of proteins in energy <unk> systems .
in energy <unk> systems the direction of energy transfer is proposed to be maintained by the synchronized turnovers of the conformational change of one protein coupling up to affect another .
catalysis by those systems implies , therefore , that under new space restrictions the groups of the <unk> enzyme increase and decrease reactivity between themselves , with <unk> and/or inhibitory ligands ( <unk> , h2o , metals , etc. ) and with the electron shells of the reactant molecules .
the <unk> <unk> turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained , therefore , under asymmetric phase angles of <unk> reactivity that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of <unk> systems .
some well known reactions , such as hemoglobins bohr effect , can be used to illustrate that microscopic ( molecular ) interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly <unk> as driving forces in energy <unk> sytems .
this would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a <unk> force of the structural parameters of proteins .
similarly , the relationship between the <unk> states of hemoglobin and its change in conformation has been used to develop an illustrative model relating changes in <unk> of electron carriers to <unk> effects leading to a sequence of atpase forms in transition complexes which become stabilized as high energy intermediates under the constraints imposed by the membrane of energy <unk> organelles .
some properties of a protease ( <unk> bpn ' ) immobilized to porous glass .
<unk> bpn ' was immobilized to porous glass via isothiocyanate coupling .
the ph optimum of the enzyme was shifted to the alkaline side on binding .
this effect was more pronounced with ethyl lactate than with <unk> arginine methyl ester ( tame ) .
presumably , the shift is a reflection of the negative charge on the surface of the glass .
the michaelis constant and vmax of soluble <unk> bpn ' with tame were two and one orders of magnitude , respectively , lower than with ethyl lactate .
vmax , calculated per g of active enzyme , with tame as the substrate was not affected by immobilization , while vmax with ethyl lactate decreased greater than tenfold .
the apparent km decreased on immobilization with ethyl lactate as substrate and increased with tame .
results are explained in terms of <unk> resistance and a possible attraction of ethyl lactate to the glass surface .
active site titration indicated that about 25 % of the immobilized enzyme was active .
profiles for ph , temperature , and dissolved o2 levels in enzyme production : monitoring in small-scale <unk> .
the profiles thus established may be utilized for investigations of an <unk> relationship to its microenvironment including metabolic shifts and pathways .
areas of maximum respiratory activity , enzyme production , enzyme degradation , and attainment of the stationary phase are quite evident ; however , duration and magnitude of the various phenomena may change with nutrient , temperature , and aeration efficiency .
practical application of this simplified method would include : a ) determination of environmental conditions existing during maximum growth or enzyme synthesis and application of these conditions to feedback control ; b ) estimation of requirements for ph , oxygen , and heat removal capacities needed for scale-up ; c ) specific points during the fermentation at which samples should be analyzed to yield maximum information on depletion of nutrients and its effects on microbial activity .

the specificity of <unk> antibodies in patients and healthy donors with no or minimal signs of infectious mononucleosis .
over several years sera were collected from 14 <unk> students or patients who did not fulfill minimal hematologic criteria for infectious mononucleosis ( i.m. ) the specificity of these <unk> reactions for i.m. was investigated by determining antibodies to epstein-barr <unk> antigens , i.e. , to viral capsid antigens ( vca ) , early antigens ( ea ) , and <unk> nuclear antigens ( <unk> ) .
on the basis of detectable <unk> and/or the early absence and late emergence of <unk> , four of these 14 individuals showed evidence of a current or very recent primary epstein-barr virus infection .
the other ten patients showed antibody patterns indicative of epstein-barr virus infections in the past , and no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to the specificity of their <unk> reactions .
it was assumed , however , that some represented atypical clinical forms of ebv infection and that timing of specimen collection was a factor in explaining the paucity of downey cells .
in three patients , the absorbed <unk> reactions persisted with little change in titer for at least 22 mo and thus might represent false-positive tests .
bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anaemia from a <unk> and <unk> unrelated donor .
<unk> transplantation ( bmt ) from an unrelated , <unk> , <unk> donor was performed in a 31 year old woman with severe longlasting aplastic anemia .
in vitro assays failed to demonstrate humoral or cellular sensitization of the recipient against <unk> antigens .
following conditioning with cyclophosphamide , prompt but only transient <unk> of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild <unk> ( gvhd ) of the liver .
the results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor can not be evaluated due to early death of the recipient .
it is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated , <unk> and <unk> donors may <unk> without severe gvhd .
rejection of the graft in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between <unk> and <unk> unrelated individuals than between <unk> and <unk> siblings .
however , insufficient preparative immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide due to severe hepatic <unk> appears equally likely as the cause of graft rejection .
the possibly increased risk of graft rejection or severe gvhd should not preclude the use of unrelated <unk> and <unk> marrow donors , when <unk> sibling donors are not available ; but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the cyclophosphamide protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent <unk> .

evidence for noradrenaline and adrenaline as sympathetic transmitters in the chicken .
1 the concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline in various organs , arterial plasma and venous outflow from isolated hearts of adult chickens have been determined .
2 the relative adrenaline concentrations ( percentage of the sum of noradrenaline and adrenaline ) in the heart ( 33 % ) , spleen ( 16 % ) and brain ( 26 % ) were higher than those found in mammalian organs .
chemical sympathectomy by pretreatment with <unk> caused a decrease of the noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations in the heart to 20 and 23 % and in the spleen to 16 and 29 % , respectively .
3 stimulation of the right sympathetic nerves , infusion of tyramine or infusion of a modified <unk> solution containing <unk> <unk> and 44 mm <unk> caused an output of both noradrenaline and adrenaline into the <unk> of isolated hearts .
the relative adrenaline concentration in the <unk> ( 20-28 % ) was not significantly different from the relative adrenaline concentration remaining in these hearts ( 19-22 % ) .
in the individual experiments , the noradrenaline : adrenaline ratios of the stimulation <unk> were positively correlated with the ratios found in the hearts .
4 the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on cardiac rate and tension development were studied in spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven left atria , respectively .
in addition , the arterial pressure rise in response to noradrenaline or adrenaline was ; measured in chickens .
it was found that the <unk> rate , cardiac tension development and arterial blood pressure , was not significantly different from that of adrenaline .
5 it is concluded that , in the chicken heart and spleen , both noradrenaline and adrenaline act as sympathetic <unk> .
antiarrhythmic , haemodynamic and metabolic effects of <unk> hydrochloride in greyhounds following acute coronary artery ligation .
1 the antiarrhythmic , haemodynamic and metabolic effects of a new amino steroid , <unk> , have been investigated in experimental acute myocardial infarction in anaesthetized greyhounds .
2 <unk> administered either intravenously ( 2-10 mg/kg ) or orally ( 50 mg/kg ) significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats in the first 30 min after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery .
3 in dogs pretreated with <unk> , metabolic changes indicative of myocardial ischaemia ( lactate production and potassium efflux ) were less marked than those occurring in control animals .
4 antiarrhythmic doses of <unk> caused only minimal transient haemodynamic effects .
5 these results suggest that <unk> may possess distinct advantages over <unk> antiarrhythmic drugs in the prevention and treatment of the early arrhythmias which occur after myocardial infarction .
the use of radioactive microspheres to compare the effects of hydralazine , <unk> and sk & f <unk> on the redistribution of cardiac output in anaesthetized rabbits .
1 the use of radioactive microspheres is described for the measurement of cardiac output in anaesthetized rabbits and its redistribution after the administration of drugs which lower blood pressure .
2 hydralazine increased peripheral vascular conductance by 123 % .
the vascular beds in which it had most effect were those of the carcass ( mainly muscle ) and the kidneys .
3 sk & f <unk> , ( 1,4 <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> , <unk> acid diethyl ester ) , had similar <unk> actions .
its effect in the carcass contributed relatively more to the increase of total peripheral conductance .
it also caused a remarkable degree of cerebral <unk> .
4 <unk> had a relatively small effect on total peripheral conductance and lowered blood pressure mainly by reducing stroke volume and cardiac output .
impact of psychosocial factors on the conduct of combined drug and psychotherapy research .
the effect of attitudes of therapists , patients and researchers on the conduct and outcome of combined drug and psychotherapy research was examined in a brief <unk> psychotherapy clinic .
seventy-seven consecutive patients were given one of two anti-anxiety drugs or a placebo in <unk> with the typical <unk> treatment used in the clinic .
the therapists ' attitudes favouring psychotherapy over drug therapy ( and psychotherapy research ) were clearly conveyed to the patients .
indicative of this are the following : ( a ) 82 per cent of the patients dropped out of drug taking , although a similar percentage remained in treatment ; ( b ) only a third of the patients perceived it as being important to their therapists that they should take medication ; ( c ) 87 per cent of the patients were rated as improved ; and 75 per cent of patients completing forms considered that most or all of their improvement was attributable to talking .
the research team , made up of members of the same department who therefore had similar values as the therapists , diligently collected outcome data , but ignored its responsibility to enforce <unk> portions of the protocol .
overall , patients remained in therapy , improved and participated in completing forms , so that only the research goals of combined therapy were thwarted , while traditional clinic service and training goals proceeded as usual .

neurochemical studies in a mouse teratoma with <unk> differentiation .
presence of cyclic amp , serotonin and enzymes of the serotonergic , adrenergic and cholinergic systems .
a transplantable mouse testicular teratoma ( ott <unk> ) which displays a spectrum of <unk> differentiation was evaluated biochemically for concentrations of cyclic amp ( camp ) , serotonin ( 5-ht ) , and enzymes involved in the metabolism of the biogenic amines and acetylcholine .
these values were compared between teratomas with <unk> differentiation as the major or minor component and brains of neonatal and adult mice of related strains .
camp , 5-ht , tryptophan hydroxylase ( tph ) , aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( <unk> ) and monoamine oxidase ( mao ) were present .
in addition , enzymes of the adrenergic system , i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ) and <unk> ( dbh ) , and of the cholinergic system , i.e. choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase , were studied .
biochemical differences in tumor groups probably reflected variations in the proportion of <unk> components : trends suggested an increase of camp and an increased activity of tph , <unk> , th and dbh in tumors with increased proportions of <unk> cells .
these findings indicate that the <unk> component of the mouse teratoma may serve as a model for the study of neuronal differentiation in primitive <unk> neoplasms .
<unk> regulation of the development of end organ innervation by sympathetic neurons .
to examine the regulation of development of end organ innervation the superior cervical ganglion ( scg ) , and two of its target organs , the iris and pineal gland , were studied using biochemical and <unk> approaches .
during postnatal ontogeny the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase ( <unk> ) , which is localized to adrenergic neurons , increased 50-fold in iris , and <unk> in pineal nerve terminals of the rat .
these increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris [ 3h ] norepinephrine ( [ 3h ] ne ) uptake , a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane .
these biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation , adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber fluorescence intensity as determined by fluorescence microscopy .
unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the scg in <unk> rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation : <unk> activity , [ 3h ] ne uptake , innervation density , plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in <unk> innervated by decentralized ganglia .
it is concluded that <unk> factors regulate the maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals , and the development of end organ innervation by scg .
mechanism of action of <unk> and <unk> on rat placental alkaline phosphatase .
i. studies on the soluble <unk> and <unk> alkaline phosphatases .
rat placental alkaline phosphatase ( ec <unk> ) , a dimer of 135,000 daltons , is strongly activated by <unk> .
however , <unk> has to be present on the <unk> to obtain this activation .
<unk> alone is unable to reconstitute functional active sites .
excess <unk> which competes for the <unk> site leads to a phosphatase with little catalytic activity at alkaline ph but with normal active sites at acidic ph as shown by covalent incorporation of <unk> [ 32p ] phosphate .
two enzyme species with identical functional active sites have been reconstituted that only differ by the presence of <unk> or <unk> at the effector site .
a mechanism is presented by which alkaline phosphatase activity of rat placenta would be controlled by a molecular process involving the interaction of <unk> and <unk> with the dimeric enzyme molecule .
porcine chymotrypsin <unk> , a more acidic chymotrypsin .
a kinetic study of <unk> chymotrypsin <unk> revealed two characteristic properties of this type of chymotrypsin : 1. porcine chymotrypsin <unk> , like bovine chymotrypsin <unk> does not bind <unk> , which is a competitive inhibitor of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin <unk> .
2. the ph profiles of the steady-state parameters show the two usual important <unk> .
the basic one , <unk> = 9.6 , affects both km and <unk> and probably controls the binding conformation of chymotrypsin .
the acidic one , <unk> = 5.7 , affects <unk> and <unk> and plays a role in the catalytic process .
the value of <unk> is unusually low .
properties of a free and a <unk> form of bound alpha , <unk> purified from honey bee thorax .
the free and bound forms of alpha , <unk> ( ec <unk> ) of the honey bee thorax were separated and the bound enzyme was <unk> by raising the ph to 8.0 for 10 h .
both enzymes were purified .
they were homogeneous as determined by several electrophoretic criteria .
it was found that the two enzymes had very similar <unk> ( each about 0.89 mm ) , <unk> ( 53.2 and 54.3 <unk> for free and <unk> , respectively ) , inhibition characteristics , specificities ( both only hydrolyzed alpha , <unk> ) , ph maxima ( each had maxima at about 3.5 and 6.5 ) , molecular weights ( 65,000 ) , isoelectric points ( 5.1 ) , <unk> to sulfhydryl reagents , electrophoretic mobilities , activation energies ( about 12.8 kcal/mol ) , and similar stabilities to heat , ph , and urea .
some significant differences between the two enzymes were , however , found : the <unk> alpha , <unk> floated at 70 % saturation of ammonium sulfate while the free alpha , <unk> did not ; the <unk> alpha , <unk> did not dissociate into subunits as readily as did the free one ; and the <unk> alpha , <unk> was found to bind more readily to a hydrophobic grouping than the free enzyme .
in addition to these comparisons , three new findings relating to thorax alpha , <unk> are reported .
( 1 ) thorax alpha , <unk> are strongly inhibited by <unk> ( ki values of about 8 x 10 ( -4 ) m ) ; ( 2 ) under certain conditions thorax alpha , <unk> from honey bees dissociated into subunits of one-half the normal molecular weight ; ( 3 ) honey bee thorax alpha , <unk> have unusual biphasic ph activity profiles .
immunotherapy for cancer : an overview .
immunotherapy of cancer is of interest to oncologists because it is specifically directed to cancer cells , sparing normal cells .
while it is ineffective in most patients , especially those with widespread metastatic disease , it occasionally produces good results .
each of the available methods has inherent problems and , recently , attempts have been made to overcome some of these .
there is a strong case for small-scale experimental trials in highly selected groups of patients who are intensively investigated for their immunologic status in relation to their tumour .
despite the lack of success in general , immunotherapy still appears to have a future as an adjunct to existing therapy in order to control as much as to cure residual tumour .

<unk> [ alphas , 5s ] <unk> acid ( <unk> ) : a new amino acid antibiotic with the properties of an antagonist of l-glutamine .
<unk> [ <unk> ] <unk> acid ( <unk> ) , an antibiotic elaborated by streptomyces <unk> , has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of many mammalian and bacterial reactions involving the transfer of nitrogen from the <unk> of l-glutamine .
thus , the utilization of l-glutamine for the synthesis of <unk> phosphate , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ribonucleotide , nad , <unk> , and <unk> acid is strongly or totally inhibited by a concentration of <unk> of 1 x 10 ( -3 ) m .
l-glutamate synthetase of escherichia coli is only modestly inhibited and <unk> synthesis in fetal rat liver is comparatively refractory to inhibition .
<unk> treatment of <unk> cells growing in a low l-glutamine culture medium produced arrest in g or early s phase .
of the amino acids tested , only l-glutamine antagonized such growth inhibition .
antitumor and immunosuppressive activities of <unk> antibiotics : structure-activity relationships .
the antitumor and immunosuppressive activities of the <unk> antibiotics were studied in mice .
seventeen of 29 newly prepared <unk> antibiotics , including <unk> of <unk> c , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , possessed considerable antitumor activity against ascites <unk> <unk> .
comparative studies on the antitumor activity of <unk> c and eight of its derivatives against <unk> leukemia and solid <unk> <unk> demonstrated that replacement of the hydroxyl group at position 8 or 14 of <unk> c by an <unk> group potentiated antitumor activity .
however , these modifications of <unk> c resulted in reduction of the immunosuppressive activity .

evidence for a physiological role of renal sympathetic nerves in adrenergic stimulation of renin release in the rat .
previous studies on renin release by an in vitro system of rat kidney slices , which is devoid of hemodynamic influences , have provided evidence that renin release is stimulated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism .
we used this system to study effects of tyramine ( an indirectly acting amine capable of displacing endogenous <unk> from sympathetic nerve endings ) on renin release .
tyramine ( 10 ( -3 ) m ) in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( <unk> , 10 ( -5 ) m ) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( theophylline , 10 ( -3 ) m ) significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) stimulated renin release when values were compared to control observations for media containing only the inhibitors .
<unk> stimulation of renin release was blocked by the <unk> agent , propranolol ( 2 x 10 ( -4 ) m ) , and the neural uptake blocking agent , cocaine ( 10 ( -5 ) m ) , but not by the <unk> , <unk> ( 9 x 10 ( -4 ) m ) .
these observations demonstrate a potential role for the sympathetic innervation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on renin release .
effects of storage in the cold on activity of <unk> in serum .
sera from patients with hepatobiliary disorders were selected to represent a wide range of activity of <unk> ( ec <unk> ) .
samples were stored at 4 degrees c and periodically tested for as long as nine weeks , others at -6 degrees c for as long as 40 weeks .
the <unk> samples were thawed and then frozen again after each testing .
the activity of the enzyme was essentially unchanged under both conditions of storage .
these results are consistent with comments in the literature on the <unk> stability .
letter : optimal <unk> assay ?
quantitative fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes according to their <unk> .
continuous monitoring of heat denaturation of a mixture of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes at 60 degrees c and ph 7.5 permits the simultaneous direct identification and quantitation of three isoenzymes : the placental isoenzyme , the <unk> intestinal isoenzyme , and the liver isoenzyme ( <unk> ) .
the isoenzyme that is principally of bone origin can not be identified as such without the help of other diagnostic aids and the <unk> medical history .
all human tissues contain alkaline phosphatase , many organs more than one of the isoenzymes .
liver alkaline phosphatase , which constitutes 40-50 % of normal serum alkaline phosphatase activity , was measured in the serum of persons with various liver diseases .
its activity exceeded normal in all types of liver disease ; in 80 % of cases this increase was accompanied by increased <unk> activity , but the quantitative <unk> ( r = 0.54 ) was not as good as expected if both enzymes come from the same source and are indices of liver <unk> .
liver alkaline phosphatase activity increases in the blood early in liver disease , before most liver tests show abnormalities .
the other major isoenzyme of normal serum probably represents a mixture of isoenzymes from bone and <unk> and vascular tissues , which all contain the same `` very <unk> '' alkaline phosphatase .
cord blood and <unk> sera contain mostly this very <unk> isoenzyme .
spectrophotometric end-point method for assay of serum <unk> in pregnancy .
an optimized end-point method that requires little sophisticated equipment is described for estimating serum <unk> during pregnancy .
<unk> is used as the substrate .
improved separation of creatine kinase cardiac isoenzyme in serum by batch fractionation .
i describe a simple , <unk> batch fractionation procedure for separating mm and mb isoenzymes of creatine kinase on a <unk> strong anion exchanger ( ag <unk> , <unk> laboratories ) .
the isoenzymes can be separated in less than 3 min , with a resulting dilution of the serum with no more than an equal volume of buffer .
without sample concentration or <unk> measurement , the procedure detects 4 u of mb isoenzyme per liter .
sensitivity is limited by the sensitivity and precision of the method of measurement .
the cv for the fractionation can be held to less than 4.0 % at 65 u of mb per liter .
current fractionation methods are compared to the proposed procedure .
with use of a discrete analyzer ( du pont aca ) the mean mb activity in a population free of heart disease was 3.2 <unk> 3.0 <unk> ( range , 0 to 8 <unk> ) .
the kinetics and stability of isolated isoenzymes are reported , indicating that advisability of storing or <unk> samples with <unk> .
the dependence of tryptamine excretion on urinary ph .
it is demonstrated that urinary tryptamine decreases significantly with increasing urinary ph .
this effect becomes important at a urinary ph of 6.5 and over .
a stabilising factor for <unk> <unk> in urine .
urinary <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) has been found to be stable when stored at room temperature and 4 degrees c .
activity is lost rapidly when urine is frozen but prior dialysis will prevent this loss .
urea is the major factor responsible for the loss of activity ; albumin is protective at concentrations of 6 g/l or more .
a factor of 10 <unk> 000 molecular weight which will prevent the loss of urinary <unk> activity on freezing has been found in serum and urine ; it has high potency in serum and in urine from patients with chronic renal failure , but only low potency in normal urine .
its nature is unknown but it is heat stable .
properties of <unk> activity in human synovial fluid .
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the properties of <unk> ( ec <unk> ) in human synovial fluid .
it was shown to have a ph requirement of 5.0 and a km value of about 8.0 - 10 ( -3 ) m using phenolphthalein <unk> as the substrate .
at low substrate concentration an endogenous inhibitor is demonstrable .
the inhibition is of the competitive type and is removed by proteolytic digestion of synovial fluid , whereas <unk> digestion and addition either of triton <unk> or of various salts to the assay mixture , are ineffective .
the possibility that the inhibitor is a protein from serum is discussed .
<unk> isomerase deficiency due to a new variant ( gp i barcelona ) and to a silent gene : biochemical , immunological and genetic studies .
a 12-year-old girl of spanish origin was found to be double heterozygote for a deficient gp i variant ( gp i barcelona ) and for a silent gp i gene .
the mother was heterozygote for gp i barcelona and the father was heterozygote for the silent gene .
gp i barcelona was a fast variant ( 116 % ) with an increased isoelectric point ( 9.55 ) , lability to heat and to urea , and shift of the ph curve towards the acidic ph .
the other kinetic characteristics were normal .
the ratio of enzymatic activity to immunological reactivity was normal in erythrocytes and white blood cells of the father and the mother but decreased to 75 % of normal in blood cells of the daughter .
the genetic and molecular mechanisms of gp i deficiency of this patient are discussed .

fc and c3 receptors occurring together and separately on t cells and other <unk> .
a method is described for detecting the simultaneous presence of fc and c3 receptors on mouse spleen cells .
a proportion of both t cells and <unk> cells bear both receptors .
both t-cell and <unk> fc receptors were blocked by aggregated mouse <unk> to the same degree .
c3 , but not fc , receptors were blocked by factors present in the serum of irradiated mice or mice undergoing graft-versus-host reaction .
thymocytes activated by injection into irradiated f1 hybrid mice , and thymocytes regenerating after irradiation and bone marrow injection , appeared to have increased fc receptors .
a general role for fc and c3 receptors in t <unk> cell co-operation is suggested .
ontogeny of immunity in humans .
<unk> toxicity induced by phenobarbital .
because of reports of <unk> toxicity in man , the effect of phenobarbital treatment on the toxicity and metabolism of <unk> was studied in 9 rhesus monkeys .
six monkeys that were exposed to a mean calculated alveolar <unk> concentration of 5.8 % for <unk> periods up to a total of 16 hr showed no evidence of toxicity .
two animals were sacrificed after a single <unk> exposure to obtain control measures of <unk> metabolites in tissues .
four monkeys that had previously survived received exposures to <unk> and 3 monkeys that had no exposure to <unk> died during <unk> anesthesia after treatment with phenobarbital ( mean time , 3 hr ) .
toxicity was manifested by arterial hypotension , pulmonary edema , and arterial hypoxemia .
phenobarbital treatment enhanced production of <unk> metabolites , including the highly toxic <unk> .
concentrations of <unk> in <unk> gas , blood , and urine , and of total nonvolatile fluorine in blood , urine , and tissues of animals treated with phenobarbital were 2 to 10 times as in control animals .
the results suggest that the rhesus monkey is a valuable model for the study of <unk> pharmacology and that inclusion of an <unk> challenge in the evaluation of potential toxicity of other anesthetics seems warranted .
plasma concentrations and the <unk> of beta blockade due to propranolol .
the effectiveness of intravenously administered propranolol in antagonizing the <unk> effect of <unk> and exercise has been investigated , and has been found at all times to be a predictable function of its plasma concentrations according to the classical <unk> theory for competitive antagonism .
the data show further that the relationship between effectiveness and time depends on the way in which antagonism is measured .
if the dose ratio to <unk> ( dr ) is measured , then ( dr-1 ) declines with time in parallel with drug concentration .
on the other hand , if <unk> effects are measured as percentage reduction in a given response , then this declines linearly with time , even though plasma concentrations decline exponentially .
this fact explains why confusion has in the past arisen concerning the relationship of the duration of beta blockade and pharmacokinetic half-life .
evaluation of lorazepam and pentobarbital as surgical <unk> .
lorazepam , a new benzodiazepine , was compared with a standard surgical <unk> , pentobarbital .
in a double-blind study in 128 patients , lorazepam , 2 and 4 mg , and pentobarbital , 50 and 100 mg , were given intravenously in a randomized sequence .
significant differences were noted ; lorazepam was found to provide greater sedation , lack of recall , and greater antianxiety effect than pentobarbital .
no significant adverse effects were noted following either drug .
vital signs remained stable .
the renal elimination of <unk> .
the question of ph or flow dependence for the renal elimination of <unk> ( pca ) was studied under 4 conditions in each of 4 subjects .
each subject received 500 mg of pca intravenously at weekly intervals while in a state of ( 1 ) acid load ( <unk> ) and water deprivation , ( 2 ) acid load and water excess , ( 3 ) alkali load ( <unk> ) and water deprivation , and ( 4 ) alkali load and water excess .
plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for pca and <unk> pca ( napa ) analysis .
urine flow rates varied markedly between the water deprivation and water excess states ( approximately 1.2 vs 5 ml/min , respectively ) , and urine ph varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states ( ph = ca 5 vs 8 , respectively ) .
despite this marked variation , there were no significant changes in pca renal clearance or 24-hr pca or napa excretion .
if passive diffusion of pca were taking place , such flow and ph changes would have caused marked changes in pca clearance were the ph partition hypothesis true .
we therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of pca in man and that there must be tubular secretion .
the implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and ph .
seasonal variations in the composition of urine in relation to calcium <unk> .
1. a retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out on data derived from single 24 h urine collections from 246 male idiopathic calcium <unk> .
2. the daily urine volume and ph and the <unk> of calcium , oxalate , phosphate , creatinine and magnesium were related to the time of year when the urine was collected , and the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and <unk> phosphate calculated for each month .
3. there were significant seasonal variations in the urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate , each showing a maximum during the summer months and a minimum in the winter .
there was no significant seasonal variation in urinary ph , volume , creatinine , phosphate or magnesium .
<unk> there was a significant increase in the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and a trend towards higher saturation levels of <unk> phosphate in the summer .
these changes were dependent only on the seasonal variation in urinary calcium and oxalate and not on urine volume .
5. a retrospective study of the seasonal incidence of stone episodes among these 246 <unk> showed that the rate of stone passage per month was 50 % higher in the summer than in the winter .
there was no significant seasonal variation in the incidence of stones removed surgically .

problems of the pathogenesis , clinics , and therapy of <unk> of the aorta and its branches .
138 patients with <unk> of the aorta and its branches were examined , and the clinical and morphological findings were compared .
the disease is more widespread than has been assumed so far , and is more frequent in young women .
localization of the process in the abdominal aorta with involvement ( stenosis ) of renal arteries causes <unk> hypertension , which often has a malignant course , especially with an <unk> affection of renal arteries .
in the treatment , repetitive therapeutic courses with corticosteroids and heparin are of fundamental importance .
with an isolated affection , especially in <unk> hypertension and disturbances of cerebral circulation , surgical treatment is also indicated .

lorazepam and diazepam in the treatment of neurotic anxiety : a double-blind trial .
fifty-eight neurotic patients with intense anxiety were treated with either lorazepam or diazepam in a double blind <unk> trial .
statistical analysis indicated that the two groups were homogeneous before treatment and that the results of treatment were similar for both drugs .
according to the global rating of illness week after week , after four weeks of treatment more patients on lorazepam than on diazepam were normal or had mild illness ( 82.1 % vs. 70.8 % ) .
in the investigators ' judgment , 71.9 % of the patients treated with lorazepam had an excellent or good response compared with <unk> of those treated with diazepam .
the mean reduction in score on the hamilton anxiety scale was 17.7 for lorazepam and 16.5 for diazepam .
however , none of the above differences in results were statistically significant .
the largest dose of lorazepam required in treatment was 6 mg , compared with 30 mg of diazepam .
two patients treated with lorazepam had side effects , against six with diazepam .
six patients in the diazepam group did not complete the trial , including three who discontinued because of side effects ( rash , tremors , agitation ) ; no patients in the lorazepam group dropped out .

identification and urinary excretion of <unk> , a metabolite of <unk> , in humans .
the presence of <unk> was detected in the urine of man receiving <unk> [ <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ] .
this new metabolite was identified by combined <unk> chromatography-mass spectrometry and by comparison with the synthetic compound .
an appropriate procedure for the extraction and quantitation of <unk> by <unk> chromatography on a 5 % <unk> column with the <unk> analog of <unk> as an internal standard , has been developed .
after <unk> and <unk> single dose oral administrations of <unk> , 5.2 and 8.3 % were slowly excreted in urine as <unk> within 30.5 and 36 <unk> respectively .
after <unk> oral intakes by psychiatric patients , the 24-hr urinary excretion of <unk> amounted to about 2-4 % of the <unk> dose administered .
tissue metabolites of <unk> , fluphenazine , <unk> , and perphenazine .
kinetics in chronic treatment .
repeated oral treatment of male rats with <unk> phenothiazine drugs in doses of 25 mg/kg or more daily led to an accumulation of metabolites containing an ethylenediamine group instead of the piperazine ring .
these products of ring degradation with and without removal of the <unk> group were found , together with the parent drugs and their <unk> metabolites , in liver , lung , kidney , and spleen , as well as in brain when high doses were administered .
after termination of treatment , the ethylenediamine derivatives were eliminated more slowly than were their congeners containing the intact piperazine ring .
parallel observations were made in dogs given fluphenazine in daily doses of up to 40 mg/kg .
quantitative differences were observed in the relative amounts of <unk> and <unk> ethylenediamine metabolites accumulated in rat tissues during treatment with the various drugs ; the proportion of the <unk> product formed by <unk> and ring cleavage declined in the following order : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , fluphenazine , perphenazine .
condensation products of the ethylenediamine derivatives with formaldehyde were split in the extraction procedure used .
comparative biotransformation of <unk> in rats , dogs , and monkeys .
the biotransformation of <unk> ( orf <unk> ; <unk> [ <unk> ] <unk> ) was investigated in rats , dogs , and monkeys .
urinary metabolites , representing 65 , 74 , and 87 % , respectively , of the total urinary radioactivity excreted by these three species , were isolated by preparative layer chromatography and characterized by various spectral techniques including gas <unk> spectrometry , solid probe mass spectrometry , polarimetry , and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry .
no parent drug was found in the urine of any species .
four metabolites were isolated from the rat including the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> derivatives .
<unk> metabolites were not isolated from rat urine .
five metabolites were isolated from dog urine , including <unk> , <unk> , and catechol derivatives of <unk> .
unlike the case of the rat , a <unk> ether was not detected in dog urine .
six metabolites were isolated from monkey urine .
the only major difference in metabolism in the monkey was the existence of both the <unk> and <unk> metabolites .
no <unk> ether was detected in monkey urine .
biotransformation through a common arene oxide intermediate can be proposed for these three animal species .
physiological disposition and metabolism of <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> acid , a new salicylate .
<unk> ( <unk> ) [ <unk> ] <unk> acid ( <unk> ) was quickly and completely absorbed in rats , dogs , and man .
peak levels of plasma radioactivity occurred in 1-2 hr after oral administration .
the dose was 10 mg/kg in rats and dogs , and 50 or 500 mg in man .
most of the drug in plasma was intact <unk> which was extensively bound to plasma protein .
in man the peak concentration following the <unk> dose was approximately 10 times that after the lower dose , which suggests that absorption rates of both doses were similar .
elimination of drug from plasma was dose-dependent .
the area under the curve for <unk> in plasma was 18 times higher following the <unk> dose than the <unk> dose .
dogs given 10 mg/kg orally or intravenously excreted 44 % of the dose in the urine and 42 % in the feces in 72 hr .
rats given the same dose level by either route of administration excreted 80 % in the urine and 11 % in the feces .
in man approximately 95 % of a <unk> or <unk> oral dose was excreted in the urine and 3 % in the feces , in 96 hr .
<unk> and two metabolites were present in the urine of three species .
the ether and ester <unk> were identified in human urine .
the latter metabolite was also identified in rat and dog urine .
the glycine conjugate of <unk> was not observed in the urine of the three species .
no interaction was observed between <unk> and <unk> in the prothrombin time test nor with <unk> in the glucose tolerance test .
a significant lowering of <unk> sleeping time was observed in female , but not male rats after four consecutive daily doses of <unk> .
after repeated daily administration of <unk> ( <unk> mg/kg ) , the diurnal plasma level in dogs was not significantly altered , indicating that no saturation , induction , or inhibition of its own metabolism took place .
spironolactone metabolism in man studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry .
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify metabolites of spironolactone in human blood and urine .
in three healthy men about 20 % of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 24 hr after an oral dose of [ <unk> ] spironolactone ( 200 mg + 200 <unk> ) .
about half of this radioactivity was extracted with chloroform at ph 3 and from this extract four stable metabolites were isolated by use of column and <unk> chromatography .
two of these were the previously identified metabolites , <unk> ( vii ; 2.9 % of dose ) and the <unk> ( x ; 1.8 % of the dose ) .
the remaining were the new metabolites , <unk> ( xi ; 0.8 % of dose ) and the <unk> derivatives ( vi ; 0.5 % of dose ) .
the principal water-soluble urinary metabolite was <unk> ester glucuronide ( xii ; 4.5 % of dose ) .
in the <unk> to <unk> pooled serum , <unk> ( vii ) was the principal metabolite in the <unk> fraction ; vi was present in appreciable amounts but x and xi were present at extremely low levels .
<unk> : the second major metabolite of <unk> in man .
after oral administration of <unk> <unk> to healthy subjects , most of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and only 4-5 % in feces over a period of 6 days .
no unchanged <unk> was excreted .
two major metabolites were found and isolated .
one was <unk> , which has been previously identified by <unk> .
the second could be identified as <unk> on the basis of its spectral and chemical properties .
correlation of <unk> metabolism in rat liver <unk> , isolated perfused rat livers , and in rats with bile duct <unk> .
the metabolism of <unk> has been compared in rat liver <unk> , isolated perfused rat livers , and rats with bile duct <unk> .
in all three preparations , <unk> and <unk> were the major metabolites .
the ratio of total <unk> to <unk> formed was 1.20 , 0.89 , and 1.01 in liver <unk> , isolated perfused livers , and rats with bile duct <unk> , respectively .
after a <unk> incubation with liver <unk> , most ( 96 % ) of the <unk> remained unchanged .
only small amounts of <unk> ( 1.26 % ) of dose ) and <unk> ( 1.05 % of dose ) were formed .
in isolated perfused liver , most of the drug ( 59 % of dose ) was excreted into bile within 4 hr , primarily as <unk> ( 24 % of dose ) and <unk> ( 24 % of dose ) .
in animals with bile duct <unk> , 65 % of the dose was excreted into bile and 18 % of the dose into urine within 4 hours .
in bile , 32 % of the dose was excreted as <unk> and 20 % of the dose as <unk> , whereas in urine the drug was <unk> predominantly as <unk> ( 13 % of dose ) with only a small amount of <unk> ( 1 % of dose ) , during the first 4 hr .
these results show that there is good correlation in the metabolic fate of <unk> in the liver <unk> , isolated perfused liver , and rats with bile duct <unk> .
in addition to the similar ratio of <unk> to <unk> , there is also an agreement in the extent of metabolism and biliary excretion in isolated perfused liver and in rats with bile duct <unk> , which suggests that the isolated perfused liver is an important technique for studying drug metabolism in animals .
oxidative biotransformation of <unk> in fetal and placental tissues of humans and monkeys .
correlations with aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities .
the <unk> oxidation of <unk> <unk> ( aaf ) was investigated in placental and fetal tissues of humans and monkeys ( macaca <unk> ) in vitro .
the major metabolite formed in most tissues was <unk> .
rates of the hydroxylation reactions varied widely among the tissues investigated and were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in rat hepatic tissues .
high correlations among rates of <unk> , and <unk> and between <unk> and <unk> of aaf were observed .
the latter two reactions were less responsive to inhibition by carbon monoxide .
rates of <unk> of benzo [ a ] pyrene ( bp ) also were highly correlated with rates of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of aaf but were not correlated with rates of <unk> and <unk> in human placental <unk> .
a lack of statistically significant correlations was observed among rates of many of these hydroxylation reactions studied in primate fetal tissues .
rates of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of aaf were not statistically correlated with rates of <unk> of bp in <unk> of primate fetal tissues in most instances , but statistically significant correlations among rates of <unk> of bp and <unk> and <unk> of aaf were observed in those preparations .
the results suggested two separate mechanisms for the genetic control of rates of placental aromatic <unk> and <unk> reactions as opposed to apparent multiple genetic controls for rates of these hydroxylation reactions in primate fetal tissues .
effect of <unk> treatment on phenacetin <unk> in several inbred mouse strains .
an increase in the metabolism of phenacetin to <unk> is correlated with benzo [ a ] pyrene hydroxylase induction by <unk> among several inbred mouse strains .
while the magnitude of induction of phenacetin <unk> is considerably less than that of benzo [ a ] pyrene hydroxylation , the data indicate that in mice , the metabolism of these two substrates is under similar regulatory control .
further studies of <unk> effects upon <unk> hydroxylation .
the enhancing effect of <unk> upon the <unk> of <unk> has been confirmed with the use of a new <unk> method for the determination of acetaminophen .
this effect has been shown not to be due to inhibition of hydrolysis of acetaminophen or interference with its determination , or to preferential formation of other phenolic metabolites .
this effect of <unk> is remarkably <unk> : phenol formation from the homologues of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and that from the sulfonamide analog of <unk> , <unk> , is inhibited by <unk> over the concentration range in which <unk> hydroxylation is enhanced .
the same substrate specificity was observed when the modifier was acetophenone .
alpha , <unk> , however , enhances phenol formation from all three <unk> , but does not affect that from <unk> .
nature and fate of insecticide residues inhaled by rats in cigarette smoke .
radioactive carbaryl , carbofuran , parathion , <unk> , and ddt were added to cigarettes and the mainstream smoke was directed to the lungs of rats via the trachea .
total radiocarbon transfer to the lungs ranged from 9 to 15 % of that in the tobacco burned during a smoking process involving eight <unk> puffs .
exhalation of 14c residues during this time was 24 to 30 % of that inhaled with all insecticides except carbofuran , of which 42 % of the residues was exhaled .
after 5 hr , total exhalation of the consumed radiocarbon was 35 % for parathion , 65 % for carbofuran , and approximately 50 % for the other products .
the nature of the 14c residues inhaled , their urinary and fecal excretion , and their deposition in and dissipation from various organs and tissues are presented .
absorption and disposition of <unk> [ <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ] <unk> acid , win 35,833 , in rats , monkeys , and men .
<unk> [ <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ] <unk> acid , win 35,833 , was readily absorbed after oral administration ; in rats , rhesus monkeys , and human volunteers , peak concentrations of drug in plasma were attained within 2 hr of medication .
the <unk> curve of administered drug was biphasic in monkeys and men , while in rats the kinetics of a <unk> model were observed .
distribution studies of <unk> drug in the rat showed that most of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces and that significant quantities of 14c were sequestered by depot fat .
monkeys and human subjects both eliminated win 35,833 primarily through the kidneys .
the drug was excreted in rat bile and human urine , both as the free acid and conjugated with glucuronic acid .
at physiological concentrations , win 35,833 was extensively bound to rat , monkey , and human plasma proteins .
a <unk> method for the analysis of drug in plasma , urine , or bile gave a linear relationship between peak height ratios and concentrations , in the range of 1-60 <unk> .
the gastrointestinal absorption of methadone in the rat .
the absorption of <unk> from the gastrointestinal tract of the <unk> rat was examined by the in vivo segment technique .
duodenal absorption , measured as a function of time and dose , followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 15.6 min .
absorption was not influenced by prior or concomitant administration of a variety of drugs .
absorption from other regions of the intestine was similar to that from the duodenum ; in contrast , absorption from the stomach was markedly slower .
gastric absorption was increased by <unk> of stomach contents but was still considerably slower than from the duodenum .
gastric emptying of methadone appears to be the rate-limiting step in the overall gastrointestinal absorption of the drug , since the rate of emptying following intubation of the drug into the stomach was also considerably slower than the rate of duodenal absorption .
biliary excretion of colchicine in newborn rats .
the 24-hr ld50 of colchicine in newborn rats is 0.24 mg/kg , which is about 1/10 that observed in the adult .
the 24-hr ld50 of colchicine was relatively constant in rats over 25 days of age .
in an attempt to determine the mechanism of the increased sensitivity of the newborn rat to the toxic action of colchicine , the distribution of 3h after the administration of <unk> ( 0.1 mg/kg ) was measured in <unk> and <unk> rats .
the concentration of 3h was higher in all tissues of the newborn than the adult after ip administration , suggesting an immaturity in the pathway for colchicine elimination .
after iv administration , radioactivity disappeared much more slowly from the plasma of the newborn rat than from the adult .
this was due to a lower capacity of the liver of the newborn to concentrate colchicine and to excrete it into the bile .
development of the hepatic excretory mechanism responsible for excretion of colchicine occurred at the same age as did the increase in ld50 .
these results suggest that colchicine is more toxic in the newborn because the drug remains in the body for a longer time due to immaturity of the liver excretory process .
disposition in rats of a <unk> copolymer used in plasma fractionation .
a <unk> block copolymer of about 4750 daltons ( <unk> 108 , <unk> <unk> ) used in a new protein fractionation procedure may be infused into patients receiving therapeutic plasma fractions .
we studied the disposition and pharmacokinetics of <unk> 108 in rats as an initial step towards understanding its behavior in man .
after iv administration in rats , about 94 % of 7 or 100 mg/kg doses of <unk> polymer was excreted in the urine in 3 days .
about 6 % of the label appeared in feces .
erythrocyte membranes were not permeable to the polymer , and only the parent compound was demonstrable in urine .
twenty hours after dosing , small residues were detectable only in the kidney , liver , small intestine , and carcass .
the third phase of the plasma disappearance pattern was evident only at the larger dose , but plasma disappearance kinetics were independent of the dose in the range used here .
thus , most of <unk> 108 was eliminated rapidly in rats by renal excretion , and a smaller portion probably was removed by biliary excretion .
these results will be applied to continuing studies of <unk> 108 disposition in man .
uptake and disposition of aldrin and dieldrin by isolated perfused rabbit lung .
the uptake , metabolism , and release of aldrin and dieldrin by the lungs were studied by use of isolated perfused rabbit lungs that were artificially ventilated and perfused through the pulmonary artery .
both recirculating and single-pass experiments were conducted using an artificial medium as <unk> .
aldrin accumulated in the lung from the <unk> through two distinct phases of uptake : a rapid phase involving simple diffusion and nonspecific binding and a slower phase representing its metabolic turnover as dieldrin .
dieldrin was not metabolized but accumulated in the lungs by a saturable and a <unk> process .
single-pass experiments with aldrin indicated that the initial velocity of uptake could be fitted to one component and a constant representing the rate of metabolism .
uptake of dieldrin was biphasic : one phase independent of the <unk> concentration and the other saturable with respect to the <unk> concentration .
by the application of michaelis-menten kinetics , the maximum amount of dieldrin accumulation attributable to the saturable component was calculated to be 0.64 <unk> .
our results indicate that the accumulation of these chlorinated xenobiotics takes place through the processes of simple diffusion followed by nonspecific tissue binding .
there was no evidence for irreversible binding of aldrin or dieldrin , its epoxide , in the lung .
while the lung plays a role in metabolizing aldrin to dieldrin followed by a transient storage , neither substrate has the potential for long-term storage in the lung .
kinetic and spectral studies of type i and type ii compounds with rat hepatic <unk> in the presence of the major metabolite of <unk> .
the nature of the inhibitory effects of the major metabolite of <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ( <unk> ) , on the in vitro metabolism of <unk> and aniline by rat hepatic <unk> was examined .
the <unk> of <unk> was competitively inhibited by <unk> , whereas inhibition of the hydroxylation of aniline was not competitive .
the spectrum produced by <unk> when added to microsomal suspensions does not resemble the classical type i or type ii spectra , but rather a reversed type i spectrum .
spectral evidence is presented indicating that <unk> also diminishes the magnitude of the spectral change produced by type i and ii compounds .
change in the kinetics of <unk> tissue distribution in walker <unk> rats .
the effect of walker tumor on <unk> distribution was studied in rats 21 days after tumor implantation in a hind leg .
after oral administration of <unk> ( 5 and 20 min ) , the concentration of the drug was found to be lower in the plasma and liver of <unk> rats when compared with that of control group .
however , 90 min after <unk> administration , the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in <unk> rats than in control animals .
whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on <unk> concentration in the brain , drug concentrations in the fat tissue of <unk> rats were constantly higher than those of control animals .
these changes in <unk> disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug .
contrary to what was observed after oral administration , constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of <unk> rats after iv injection of <unk> .
furthermore , the half-life of <unk> in these same animals was much higher than in control animals .
it is concluded that , in walker <unk> rats , there are changes in the kinetics of <unk> which are functions of the route of administration of the drug .
cytochrome p-450 measurement in rat liver <unk> and <unk> .
its use for correction of microsomal losses incurred by differential centrifugation .
cytochrome p-450 was assayed in rat liver <unk> and <unk> in order to calculate microsomal recoveries and correct for losses during <unk> or sedimentation in presence of <unk> .
the values obtained for corrected microsomal protein in untreated female <unk> rats were between 40 and 50 <unk> of liver .
the assay of cytochrome p-450 in liver <unk> is accurate enough to calculate a reproducible recovery factor .
the value of the method lies in its rapidity , its capacity to correct over a wide range of losses , and its capacity to yield reliable values of the total microsomal protein mass .
the limits of this method include overestimation of <unk> cytochrome p-450 and inability to correct for <unk> protein contamination .
overestimation of cytochrome p-450 can be corrected by measuring the difference in absorbance between 450 and 510 nm with the extinction coefficient of 100 <unk> .
to be accurate , cytochrome p-450 determination on <unk> must be done at protein concentrations of about 3 mg/ml .
the error inherent to the method may be kept constant and minimal .
the use of correction for microsomal losses is recommended in order to obtain uniformity between results from various laboratories and adequate correlation with in vivo studies of microsomal functions .

identification of `` big '' human placental <unk> in placenta and serum .
because of increasing evidence for the heterogeneity of polypeptide hormones , studies of the molecular species of human placental <unk> ( hpl ) were initiated .
when extracts of freshly delivered human placentas were passed over <unk> <unk> in <unk> ammonium carbonate , three <unk> peaks were detected .
in addition to a peak corresponding to native hpl ( kav = 0.39 ) and one in the void volume , a consistent peak which eluted before hpl ( kav = 0.20 ) was present .
the latter represented 2-25 % of total hormonal activity and could be rerun without significant conversion to hpl .
in 8m urea , the peak continued to behave as a large molecular weight form on both <unk> chromatography and on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis .
extraction procedures at both neutral and alkaline ph produced similar quantities of the larger material .
[ <unk> ] <unk> was not converted to the larger form by the conditions of extraction or analysis .
these properties are consistent with a larger molecular weight , <unk> form of hpl .
in comparison with the native hormone , the <unk> curves for the larger form were parallel in <unk> studies .
sera obtained from pregnant women during various stages of gestation also showed consistent evidence for a large molecular weight form of the hormone .
these observations provide direct evidence , both in placental tissue and in serum for `` big '' hpl .
the <unk> transfer of <unk> by bursting bubbles .
the transfer of <unk> from water to air by bursting bubbles was studied as a function of three levels each of three variables in a bubbling solution .
the variables were ph , surfactant concentration , and <unk> <unk> concentration .
one combination of the above variables was also studied at three different temperatures .
sterile water solutions containing different combinations of the above factors and a fixed amount of <unk> were bubbled in an enclosure for 1 hour .
after bubbling , samples of the aerosol produced , the larger drops that fell out of the air , and the bulk solution were collected and assayed for their 35s and <unk> content using liquid scintillation counting .
the <unk> enrichment for each droplet sample as compared to the ratio for the bulk solution was determined , and it was found to be dependent upon the combination of the factor levels being bubbled .
both positive and negative enrichments were found , with large positive enrichments being found consistently only for the highest value of surfactant concentration .
the temperature study showed no significant enrichment differences for any of the three temperatures studied .
differential effects of phenobarbital and pentobarbital on isolated nervous tissue .
<unk> after discharges evoked by repetitive electrical stimulation of chronically isolated cortical slabs ( cat ) were shortened by low doses of phenobarbital but not affected by hypnotic doses of pentobarbital .
both pentobarbital and phenobarbital raised threshold and lowered spike amplitude in isolated sciatic nerves .
the action of both drugs was increased by reducing na in the medium and by decreasing the <unk> ph .
similar to the action of other general anesthetics , the axonal effect of pentobarbital was enhanced by d2o replacement for h2o in the <unk> ( suggesting that tissue water is involved in pentobarbital action ) , whereas d2o replacement did not modify the action of phenobarbital or of local anesthetics .
these results suggest that the varying in vivo effects of pentobarbital and phenobarbital may be due to a difference in their action upon excitable membranes ( rather than to a different regional distribution in brain ) .
the reaction of <unk> alcohol dehydrogenase with <unk> .
horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was reacted with <unk> at different ph values ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 .
at ph 9.0 the enzyme undergoes a rapid activation over the first minutes of reaction , followed by a decline of activity , which reaches 10 % of that of the native enzyme .
chemical analysis of the inactivated enzyme after sodium borohydride reduction shows that 11 <unk> and 11 lysine residues per mole are modified .
at ph 7.7 the enzyme activity increases during the first hour of the reaction with <unk> and then decreases slowly .
chemical analysis shows that 4 arginine and 3 lysine residues per mole are modified in the enzyme at the maximum of activation .
at ph 7.0 the enzyme undergoes a 4-fold activation .
chemical analysis shows that in this activated enzyme 3 lysine and no arginine residues per mole have been modified .
steady-state kinetic analysis suggests that the activated enzyme is not subjected to substrate inhibition and that its michaelis constant for ethanol is three times larger than that of the native enzyme .
the possible role of arginine and lysine residues in the catalytic function of liver alcohol dehydrogenase is discussed .
the conformational oscillation of <unk> involvement of <unk> .
in <unk> the reactivity of <unk> towards <unk> bromide is strongly reduced when the <unk> group of <unk> has been acetylated .
since acetylation of <unk> brings <unk> to a conformation similar to its alkaline one this suggests that <unk> should present an impaired reactivity in the alkaline conformation of the protein .
it is indeed observed that its chemical reactivity as a function of ph depends on the ionization state of the <unk> group of <unk> ( <unk> 9 at 15 degrees c ) as does the structure of the enzyme .
reciprocally , after chemical reaction of <unk> with hydrogen peroxide , <unk> presents a slower rate of reaction with <unk> than when <unk> is free .
as a result of <unk> oxidation the apparent pk of the alkaline transition is shifted from 9 to about 11 at 15 degrees c .
this is reflected in the disappearance of the lag phase previously observed for the initial activity of the enzyme when it is incubated at alkaline ph [ <unk> j. <unk> ( 1973 ) <unk> ] .
the absence of chemical reactivity of <unk> in the alkaline state of the enzyme is confirmed by the appearance of a lag phase in the reaction of the protein with <unk> after an incubation at alkaline ph .
such a lag phase does not appear when this incubation is carried out at neutral ph .
since this lag phase is similar to that which shows up in the activity during the isomerization of the enzyme from its alkaline to its neutral state , the present data are interpreted as implying a concerted movement of <unk> and <unk> during this isomerization process .
they also indicate that in the alkaline form of the enzyme <unk> has moved back into the interior of the protein .
since the spectroscopic properties of the zymogen and of the <unk> form of the enzyme are similar they suggest that <unk> occupies in the alkaline conformation of the enzyme a similar position as it does in the zymogen .
investigations on the kinetic mechanism of <unk> dehydrogenase .
1. steady-state kinetics .
the kinetic mechanism of action of <unk> dehydrogenase was investigated .
this enzyme catalyses the reversible dehydrogenation of <unk> to l-arginine and pyruvate , in the presence of <unk> dinucleotide .
initial velocity and product inhibition studies were carried out in both directions .
most of the results are consistent with a <unk> sequential mechanism where <unk> binds first to the enzyme followed by <unk> , and the products are released in the order l-arginine , pyruvate and nadh .
various kinetic parameters were determined for each reactant at 33 degrees c , at ph 9.6 for nad reduction , at ph 6.6 for nadh oxidation .
the catalytic mechanism of carbonic anhydrase .
<unk> effects on the kinetic parameters of the human c isoenzyme .
1. the steady-state kinetics of the interconversion of co2 and hco3 catalyzed by human carbonic anhydrase c was studied using <unk> and 2h2o as solvents .
the <unk> parts of the parameters k ( cat ) and km are 3-4 times larger in <unk> than in 2h2o for both directions of the reaction , while the ratios k ( cat ) <unk> show much smaller isotope effects .
with either co2 or hco3 as substrate the major ph dependence is observed in k ( cat ) , while km appears independent of ph .
the pka value characterizing the <unk> profiles is approximately 0.5 unit larger in 2h2o than in <unk> .
2. the hydrolysis of <unk> acetate catalyzed by human carbonic <unk> c is approximately 35 % faster in 2h2o than in <unk> .
in both solvents the pka values of the <unk> profiles are similar to those observed for the <unk> interconversion .
3. it is tentatively proposed that the rate-limiting step at saturating concentrations of co2 or hco3 is an intramolecular proton transfer between two ionizing groups in the active site .
it can not be decided whether the transformation between <unk> co2 and hco3 involves a proton <unk> or not .
purification and properties of isoenzymes of <unk> dehydrogenase from <unk> cultures .
two isoenzymes of an <unk> <unk> <unk> alcohol dehydrogenase and an <unk> - dependent aliphatic alcohol dehydrogenase were extracted from cell suspension cultures of soybean ( glycine max l. , <unk> mandarin ) which form lignin during growth .
these enzymes could be separated from each other by chromatography on <unk> and hydroxyapatite .
the <unk> alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes were partially purified by ( nh4 ) <unk> fractionation , and column chromatography on <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and hydroxyapatite .
the molecular weight of the enzymes were estimated by the elution volumes from a <unk> <unk> column and were found to be about 43,000 ( isoenzyme 1 ) and 69,000 ( isoenzyme 2 ) .
maximum rates of reaction were observed in the case of <unk> alcohol oxidation at ph 9.2 ( isoenzyme 1 ) and ph 8.8 ( isoenzyme 2 ) ; in the reverse reaction ph 6.5 was optimal for isoenzyme 2 .
whereas isoenzyme 1 is specific for <unk> alcohol , isoenzyme 2 can also oxidize <unk> alcohol and a number of substituted <unk> alcohols , km values for substituted <unk> are 3-11 times lower than for the corresponding alcohols .
neither isoenzyme reacted with benzyl alcohol , <unk> alcohol or ethanol .
substrate inhibition for the forward and reverse reaction was found with isoenzyme 2 but not with isoenzyme 1 .
the equilibrium constant was determined to be about 10 ( 9 ) in favour of <unk> reduction .
the possible role of the <unk> alcohol dehydrogenase in lignin biosynthesis is discussed .
the <unk> complex from azotobacter <unk> .
2. regulation of the activity .
the presence of activators ( amp and sulphate ) or inhibitors ( acetyl-coa ) has no influence on the hill coefficient of the s-shaped [ pyruvate ] -- velocity curve of either the <unk> overall reaction ( h equals 2.5 ) or that of the <unk> ( cn ) 6 activity of the first enzyme ( h equals 1.3 ) .
ph studies indicated that the hill coefficient is dependent on subunit ionization within the <unk> complex and not on those in the free complex .
it is concluded that pyruvate conversion rather that pyruvate binding is responsible for the allosteric pattern .
the activity is due to absence of a protein kinase , mainly regulated at the <unk> , and <unk> levels and by the value of the energy charge .
arginine decarboxylase from lathyrus sativus seedlings .
purification and <unk> .
arginine decarboxylase which makes its appearance in lathyrus sativus seedlings after 24 h of seed germination reaches its highest level around 5-7 days , the cotyledons containing about 60 % of the total activity in the seedlings at day 5 .
the cytosol enzyme was purified <unk> from whole seedlings by steps involving manganese chloride treatment , ammonium sulphate and acetone <unk> , positive adsorption on alumina <unk> gel , <unk> chromatography followed by preparative disc gel electrophoresis .
the enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by electrophoretic and immunological criteria , had a molecular weight of 220,000 and appears to be a hexamer with identical subunits .
the optimal ph and temperature for the enzyme activity were 8.5 and 45 degrees c respectively .
the enzyme follows typical michaelis-menten kinetics with a km value of 1.73 mm for arginine .
though <unk> at lower concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity , there was no dependence of the enzyme on any metal for the activity .
the arginine decarboxylase of l. sativus is a sulfhydryl enzyme .
the data on co-factor requirement , inhibition by carbonyl reagents , reducing agents and pyridoxal phosphate inhibitors , and a partial reversal by pyridoxal phosphate of inhibition by <unk> suggests that pyridoxal <unk> is involved as a co-factor for the enzyme .
the enzyme activity was inhibited competitively by various amines including the product <unk> .
highest inhibition was obtained with <unk> and arcain .
the substrate analogue , <unk> , homologue <unk> and other basic amino acids like l-lysine and <unk> inhibited the enzyme activity competitively , <unk> being the most effective in this respect .
yeast hexokinase a .
<unk> and properties of the active subunit .
yeast hexokinase a ( atp : <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) dissociates into its subunits upon reaction with succinic anhydride .
the chemically modified subunits could be isolated in a catalytically active form .
the km values found for atp and for glucose were of the some order as those found for the native enzyme .
of the 37 amino groups present per enzyme subunit , 2-3 of these groups might be located in the proximity of the region of subunit interactions .
the 50 % loss of the initial activity , which follows the <unk> of these more reactive amino groups , does not seem to be due to the modification of a residue on the enzyme active site or to a change of the tertiary structure of the protein .
this 50 % loss of the enzyme activity may be related to the dissociation of the dimer into monomers .
both native enzyme and the <unk> subunits have the same <unk> denaturation rate profiles in response to 2 m urea .
moreover , the apparent pk of the group involved in the transition from a more stable conformation of the protein in the acid range to a less stable one at alkaline ph seems to be similar to the pk of the group implicated in the transition between the protonated inactive form of the enzyme and an active deprotonated form .
the <unk> subunit presents <unk> <unk> ' with respect to atp at slightly acid ph ; however , the <unk> slow transient in the reaction progress curve and the activation effect induced by physiological <unk> , effects observed for the native enzyme , were not detected in the standard experimental conditions with the <unk> subunit .
the <unk> of reduced <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> has been successfully <unk> in solution , after reduction of its 5 disulfide bonds in 6 m <unk> .
this has been made possible by the study of the <unk> of a model derivative , <unk> .
the reduced derivative is shown to <unk> and <unk> spontaneously , with a 30-40 % yield , into molecules which are monomeric and fully susceptible to activation by trypsin .
<unk> can also be <unk> but only in the presence of reagents allowing disulfide interchange and of moderate concentrations of <unk> or urea .
these results illustrate how the kinetic trapping of incorrectly folded molecules by wrong s-s bonds and aggregation can be overcome , thus allowing the correct refolding of the protein .
further studies on <unk> formation in isolated hepatocytes .
lipid peroxide formation was initiated by the addition of either <unk> <unk> or cumene hydroperoxide to a suspension of isolated hepatocytes .
the reaction was monitored by <unk> measurements .
upon the addition of iron , <unk> production in the cells started immediately but ceased within 30-60 min , and the response was <unk> with iron concentrations ranging from 19 to 187 mum .
<unk> formation was associated with increased oxygen uptake and conjugated diene production .
the addition in vitro of n , n , n ' , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> inhibited the <unk> <unk> production .
it was also possible to demonstrate an apparent disappearance of <unk> from fresh cells by addition of adequate amounts of n , n , n ' , <unk> ( 100 mum ) .
the attenuation of the <unk> <unk> production was found to be correlated with an increased binding of iron to an intracellular ferritin fraction .
further , <unk> formation was also associated with a conversion of reduced glutathione to the oxidized form which , in turn , revealed a faster permeation out of the cells into the surrounding medium of the oxidized than of the reduced thiol .
so , concomitant with the redox alterations , there was also an overall loss of glutathione from the cells .
cumene <unk> <unk> production could be initiated by the addition of this peroxide in concentrations ranging from 150 mum to the liver cell incubate .
with concentrations below 150 mum , a lag phase was present which seemed to be <unk> .
it is concluded that iron enters the cell , then is probably reduced inside the cell by nadph via the <unk> p-450 reductase , and in the reduced state initiates lipid peroxidation .
the reaction is inhibited by intracellular mechanisms , the glutathione redox system being of principal importance , and possibly terminated by the <unk> complex formation .
on the mechanism of <unk> and its control .
purification , kinetic mechanism and regulation of different forms of mitochondrial <unk> <unk> from ox liver .
1. two mitochondrial forms of <unk> <unk> designated as enzyme a and enzyme b were crystallized from ox liver .
they could be shown to be homogenous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
2. in direction of <unk> cleavage enzyme a shows a double competitive substrate inhibition when <unk> is varied at different fixed coa concentrations .
with enzyme b a parallel kinetic pattern is obtained when <unk> is varied at different fixed coa concentrations .
in direction of <unk> synthesis both enzymes show linear reciprocal plots of initial velocities against acetyl-coa concentrations in absence of coa .
these initial velocity kinetics in the forward and in the reverse direction are in accordance with a ping-pong mechanism of reaction for both enzymes involving an <unk> as intermediate .
3. under saturating concentrations of substrate , the ratios of <unk> <unk> cleavage is 0.31 for enzyme a and 0.08 for enzyme b .
the maximum velocity in direction of <unk> synthesis of enzymes a and b are 0.43 <unk> x <unk> x unit <unk> and 0.10 <unk> x <unk> x unit <unk> , respectively .
<unk> both enzymes show nearly the same affinity for acetyl-coa .
the km values are 91 mum ( enzyme a ) and 80 mum ( enzyme b ) .
5. coenzyme a and <unk> both act as inhibitors in direction of <unk> synthesis : coenzyme a is a nonlinear competitive inhibitor of both enzymes .
<unk> exerts a negative cooperativity on enzyme a ( nh = 0.63 ) and is a competitive inhibitor for enzyme b ( ki = 1.6 mum ) .
<unk> the catalytic and regulatory properties of the <unk> <unk> a and b are discussed in terms of their proposed role in regulating <unk> .
intracellular fluctuations of <unk> ratios , resulting in a suspension of inhibition of both enzymes at high <unk> ratios , are postulated as a control mechanism of <unk> in addition to mechanisms already known .
<unk> dehydrogenase ( <unk> enzyme ) from pseudomonas fluorescens .
purification , properties and regulation .
1. the existence of two different <unk> dehydrogenases in pseudomonas fluorescens has been demonstrated .
based on their different specificity and their different metabolic regulation one enzyme is appointed to the <unk> pathway and the other to the hexose monophosphate pathway .
2. a procedure is described for the isolation of that <unk> dehydrogenase which forms part of the <unk> pathway ( <unk> enzyme ) .
a <unk> purification was achieved with an overall yield of 44 % .
the final preparation , having a specific activity of about 300 <unk> nadh formed per min per mg protein , was shown to be homogeneous .
3. the molecular weight of the <unk> enzyme has been determined to be <unk> by gel permeation chromatography , and that of the other enzyme ( <unk> ) has been shown to be <unk> .
<unk> the pi of the <unk> enzyme has been shown to be 5.24 and that of the <unk> 4.27 .
the <unk> enzyme is stable in the range of ph 6 to 10.5 and shows its maximal activity at ph <unk> 5 .
the <unk> enzyme showed specificity for <unk> as well as for <unk> and exhibited <unk> effects for d-glucose 6-phosphate .
it is inhibited by atp which acts as a negative allosteric effector .
other nucleoside <unk> as well as adp are also inhibitory .
<unk> the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the axial hydrogen at <unk> of <unk> 6-phosphate to the si face of <unk> of the nicotinamide ring and must be classified as b-side stereospecific dehydrogenase .
purification and properties of potato <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> .
evidence against a dual catalytic function in <unk> enzyme .
<unk> , the enzyme that synthesizes the <unk> branch linkages of amylopectin , has been purified from potato to near homogeneity .
the molecular weight of the enzyme is <unk> .
the active enzyme is a monomer , with a molar activity at ph 7.0 and 24 degrees c of 15 .
the energy of activation is 25 kj/mol below 15 degrees c , changing sharply to 63 kj/mol above that temperature .
enzyme activity is not affected by <unk> or atp .
there are about 11 readily <unk> sulfhydryl groups per molecule .
the evidence that the enzyme is a single protein entity , without hydrolytic activity towards amylose , contrasts with an earlier report that <unk> consists of two components , a hydrolase with molecular weight 70000 , and a transferase with molecular weight 20000 .
<unk> acts on native and synthetic <unk> to give products resembling amylopectin in terms of average unit chain length , degress of <unk> and iodine stain .
the profiles of the unit chains of these synthetic products are , however , different from that of native amylopectin .
additional branch linkages are introduced by <unk> into potato amylopectin , but the product bears no resemblance to <unk> .
factors affecting the molecular structure and the agglutinating ability of <unk> a and other lectins .
<unk> analyses were performed on lectins under varying conditions of ph , ionic strength and temperature .
it has been demonstrated that the <unk> from phaseolus vulgaris , the wheat germ <unk> and the soybean <unk> are stable when these parameters are varied , whereas the <unk> a molecule exhibits a striking reversible <unk> transition with variation in ph ( from 6.0 to 7.2 ) and temperature ( from 4 degrees up to 37 degrees c ) .
it has also been demonstrated that , in agglutination experiments undertaken at different temperatures , cells do eventually aggregate with the first three lectins provided that incubation time is sufficient , whereas the <unk> agglutination was previously found to be temperature-sensitive .
these results strongly suggest that the effect of temperature on agglutination by lectins may essentially be due to a structural transition of the lectin itself and nott only to modification of cell surface properties .
<unk> chemical composition in <unk> and solubility properties of its structural proteins .
the chemical composition of <unk> extracted from the giant axon of <unk> infundibulum has been analysed , and some of the factors which disperse its gel structure have been identified .
2. the <unk> contains about 3-6 % protein , and 0-12 % lipid .
it is <unk> with sea water and has a ph near 7-0 .
3. inorganic ions in extracted <unk> include : <unk> , <unk> wet <unk> ; <unk> , 280 ; <unk> , 24 ; <unk> , 0-3 ; <unk> , 3. 4 .
free organic ions in <unk> include : gly , 180 <unk> wet st. ; <unk> acid , 120 ; asp , 75 ; glu , 10 ; ala , 7 ; tau , 5 ; thr , 2 ; gln and ser , trace ; <unk> , 63 ; <unk> , <unk> 5 .
the gel structure is dispersed by solutions containing 1 -- 10 <unk> , because this ion activates an endogenous protease .
the gel can also be dispersed without <unk> by solutions containing 0-5 <unk> , or 0-5 m guanidine hydrochloride , or 3-5 m urea , all of which break down <unk> .
<unk> it is argued that many aspects of the composition and dispersal properties of <unk> <unk> are similar to those in other axons .
the metabolism of <unk> by acinetobacter <unk> <unk> .
acinetobacter <unk> <unk> was isolated by elective culture on <unk> and grows with this compound as sole source of carbon .
it displays a restricted growth spectrum , being unable to grow on a wide range of alternative <unk> alcohols and ketones .
<unk> cells oxidize the growth substrate at a rate of 230 mul of <unk> per mg dry wt with the consumption of 5.65 <unk> of <unk> substrate .
cyclohexanone is oxidized at a similar rate with the consumption of 4.85 <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> are both oxidized at the same slow rate of 44 mul of <unk> per mg dry wt and <unk> is not oxidized .
studies with cell extracts reveal the presence of inducible dehydrogenases for <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and a monooxygenase , that in <unk> with a <unk> converts cyclohexanone to <unk> .
the monooxygenase is therefore presumed to be of the <unk> type and the pathway for conversion of <unk> to <unk> ; <unk> leads to cyclohexanone leads to <unk> leads to <unk> leads to <unk> leads to <unk> ; for which key intermediates have been identified <unk> , is identical with the route for the oxidation of <unk> by nocardia <unk> <unk> .
multiple forms of human glutathione <unk> and their affinity for bilirubin .
the initial <unk> step in <unk> acid formation is catalyzed by glutathione <unk> .
several species of this enzyme , designated as transferases alpha , beta , gamma , delta and epsilon on the basis of increasing isoelectric points , were isolated from human liver .
evidence is presented that each of the purified species is homogeneous with respect to sodium <unk> electrophoresis .
transferases alpha , beta and epsilon each appear as a single band on gel <unk> ; transferases gamma and delta are present as two and three bands , respectively , with each band catalytically active .
amino acid analysis indicated the five transferases to be either very closely related or identical in this respect .
all enzyme species have a molecular weight of about <unk> and consist of two apparently identical subunits .
the spectrum of substrates is the same for each although the enzymes differ slightly in specific activity .
as is the case for the rat liver enzymes , each of the human transferases binds bilirubin although this compound is not a substrate .
hydrophobic interaction determined by partition in aqueous two-phase systems .
partition of proteins in systems containing <unk> esters of poly ( ethylene glycol ) .
in this report we describe a new method which is useful for measuring hydrophobic interactions between aliphatic hydrocarbon chains and proteins in aqueous environment .
the method is based on partition of proteins in an aqueous two-phase system containing dextran and poly ( ethylene glycol ) and different fatty acid esters of poly ( ethylene glycol ) .
the partition is measured under conditions where contributions from electrostatic interactions are eliminated .
the difference in partition of proteins in phase systems with and without <unk> groups bound to poly ( ethylene glycol ) , <unk> k , where k is the partition coefficient , is taken as a measure of hydrophobic interaction .
<unk> k varies with size of hydrocarbon chain and type of protein .
the length of the aliphatic chain should be greater than 8 carbon atoms in order to get a measurable effect in terms of <unk> k .
bovine serum albumin , <unk> , hemoglobin and myoglobin have been shown to have different affinities for palmitic acid ester of poly ( ethylene glycol ) .
no hydrophobic effect could be observed for <unk> , cytochrome c or <unk> a .
<unk> phosphofructokinase .
a simple and direct approach to the study of allosteric equilibria under <unk> conditions .
rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase , <unk> at its most reactive thiol group , has an electron spin resonance spectrum which is very sensitive to the binding of substrates and allosteric effectors .
the spectral changes have been interpreted in terms of a concerted allosteric transition between two conformational states with non-exclusive binding of effectors .
on this basis <unk> , fructose 6-phosphate plus atp , and <unk> behave as potent positive effectors , inorganic phosphate , sulphate , amp , fructose 6-phosphate and fructose <unk> are less potent activators , and free atp and <unk> are negative effectors , in agreement with the kinetic behaviour , but citrate behaves anomalously .
in addition , the allosteric equilibrium can be displaced towards the inhibited state by selectively modifying two further thiol groups .
strong positive cooperativity occurs under suitable conditions with atp , <unk> and fructose 6-phosphate .
biphasic changes of conformation , attributed to binding at the catalytic and inhibitory sites , have been observed in titrations with atp .
the differentiation of the two atp binding sites arises in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate because of a distinct concerted effect on conformation between the two substrates at the active site .
a similar effect occurs between atp and citrate .
other <unk> effects are more consistent with simple models ; phosphates favour the binding , and reduce the cooperativity , of fructose 6-phosphate and <unk> , whereas excess atp and <unk> ions antagonise the binding and increase the cooperativity of fructose 6-phosphate .
the observations are related to existing kinetic and binding studies where possible .
anomalous features of the behaviour suggest that the model should be regarded only as a first approximation .
cytochrome c interaction with membranes .
absorption and emission spectra and binding characteristics of <unk> cytochrome c .
a cytochrome c derivative from which iron is removed has been prepared and characterized .
several lines of evidence indicate that native and porphyrin cytochrome c have similar conformations : they have similar elution characteristics on <unk> gel chromatography ; in both proteins the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched and the pk values of protonation of the porphyrin are identical .
porphyrin cytochrome c does not substitute for native cytochrome c in either the oxidase reaction or in restoring electron transport in <unk> mitochondria .
it does however competitively inhibit native cytochrome c in these reactions , the ki for inhibition being larger than the km for reaction .
the absorption and emission spectra , and the polarized excitation spectrum of the porphyrin cytochrome c are characteristic of free base porphyrin .
the absence of fluorescence quenching of porphyrin cytochrome c when the protein is bound to cytochrome oxidase suggests that heme to heme distance between these proteins is larger than 0.5 to 0.9 nm depending upon orientation .
binding of the porphyrin cytochrome c to phospholipids or to mitochondria increases the fluorescence polarization of a positively polarized absorption band , which indicates that the bound form of the protein does not rotate freely within the time scale of relaxation from the excited state .
the trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors in chick peas ( <unk> <unk> l. ) .
purification and properties of the inhibitors .
from a crude extract of chick peas ( <unk> <unk> l. ) inhibitors of trypsin and chymotrypsin were isolated by affinity chromatography on a column of <unk> 6b .
the content of inhibitors was found to be 1.5 g/kg .
they were further separated into six <unk> by ion-exchange chromatography on <unk> <unk> .
two of the <unk> accounted for about 50 % of the isolated inhibitors and were further purified to a homogeneous state .
the <unk> had a molecular weight of about 10000 as determined by <unk> chromatography on <unk> <unk> .
they were stable towards extremes of ph and temperatures up to 75 degrees c or towards digestion by pepsin .
they were also stable in 6 m urea but not in 6 m <unk> .
the intact inhibitors were destroyed when the peas were cooked at 100 degrees c or when they were toasted at 130 degrees c .
the four major inhibitors had similar amino acid compositions and did not contain detectable amounts of free sulfhydryl groups , tryptophan or carbohydrate .
cysteine is the dominant amino acid residue in all of them and accounted for about 20 % of their amino acid content .
the isoelectric point of the <unk> lies in the range of ph <unk> and two of the major inhibitors had isoelectric points of ph 4.75 and ph 4.96 .
they inhibited chymotrypsin to the same extent but differed in their inhibitory activities towards trypsin , indicating that they are mixtures of native and <unk> forms and that they probably have separate sites for the two enzymes .
they did not inhibit other proteolytic enzymes belonging to two groups ( i.e. , serine or cysteine enzymes ) or originating from different sources ( i.e. , animals , plants or bacteria ) .
investigations of the structure of <unk> carboxylase from <unk> .
it was shown by gel electrophoresis in sodium <unk> solution that <unk> carboxylase from <unk> ivs is composed of two different subunits with molecular weights of about <unk> and <unk> , respectively .
the biotin is bound to the heavier subunit .
it was previously found that <unk> carboxylase contains four biotin molecules per complex .
a complex composed of four of each subunit would thus have a molecular weight of about <unk> .
this is compatible with the molecular weight of <unk> determined earlier by analytical <unk> .
both subunits were isolated <unk> .
as the subunits , unlike the complex , are very sensitive to oxygen , special precautions had to be taken during isolation .
the <unk> subunit was isolated by chromatography on <unk> in 5 m urea .
it no longer catalyzed the overall reaction , yet could still carboxylate free biotin .
the <unk> subunit was separated after dissociation of the enzyme by <unk> ' dialysis at ph 9.8 under nitrogen .
on chromatography over a <unk> avidin column , the <unk> was fixed and the <unk> subunit was eluted <unk> .
the latter subunit showed no <unk> activity .
after the addition of the <unk> subunit , overall activity was regenerated .
the speed of <unk> is very much enhanced by <unk> .
it was shown by <unk> experiments under different conditions that probably an initial complex , <unk> is formed , possessing a binding site for <unk> .
upon the binding of this substrate the conformation may be changed to a form favourable for reconstitution .
finally , the structures of biotin enzymes from different sources are compared .
in the course of evolution there is a tendency toward integration of the different constituent proteins into only one polypeptide chain .
<unk> rna from vicia faba meristematic root cells .
localization and size estimation of the poly ( a ) segment .
after incubating root apices from <unk> bean seedlings with [ 3h ] adenine the rna was extracted from whole cells or <unk> , and the poly ( a ) sequences were isolated by nuclease digestion followed by poly ( u ) <unk> chromatography .
the alterations of the rna molecules due to the various treatments were monitored by sucrose density gradients .
it was found that sequential extraction first at ph 7.6 then at ph 9.0 did not result in a separation between rna poor in poly ( a ) sequences and poly ( a ) <unk> rna .
furthermore chromatography analysis of <unk> from <unk> rna extracted either at ph 7.6 or ph 9.0 revealed that amp constituted nearly 95 % of the bases and that the poly ( a ) sequences , about 200 bases , were located at the 3 ' terminus of the <unk> rna .
no size difference was found for the poly ( a ) segment between the <unk> rna and that extracted at ph 9.0 .
time-dependent inhibition of diamine oxidase by <unk> reagents and urea .
1. the behaviour of several carbonyl group reagents and urea as time-dependent inhibitors of both pig kidney and human placental diamine oxidase is described .
2. plots of log ( <unk> ) against time were not linear with these reagents as the usual theories predict .
3. this was particularly the case with <unk> and <unk> and a thorough study of the effects of these compounds on the human placental diamine oxidase is described .
<unk> by applying a new theory for time-dependent inhibition , the inhibition of diamine oxidase by <unk> and <unk> is adequately accounted for .
5. the time-dependent recovery of activity on addition of sodium pyruvate suggested that the compounds used are acting solely as carbonyl group reagents , inhibiting by <unk> formation at the <unk> carbonyl group .
<unk> : preparation and characterization .
acetylated derivatives of glucagon have been prepared by reacting this hormone under various conditions with acetic anhydride .
they have been chemically characterized by the use of a <unk> reagent , by peptide mapping techniques following hydrolysis by <unk> and chymotrypsin , and by spectroscopy .
acetylation in sodium acetate ( ph 5.5 ) results in a full substitution of the <unk> group of the n-terminal <unk> residue , but in a partial ( about 0.3 acetyl group per residue ) substitution of the <unk> group of the <unk> residue 12 .
the <unk> ( on the <unk> group ) and the <unk> ( on both amino groups ) acetylated components have been separated by chromatography on <unk> and <unk> .
acetylation in sodium bicarbonate ( ph 8.0 ) results in a complete substitution of both amino groups and of the hydroxyl groups of the <unk> residues 10 and 13 .
complete deacetylation of the <unk> residues occurs upon treatment with <unk> .
mono , di and <unk> are homogeneous when analyzed by disc gel electrophoresis ; di and <unk> derivatives show an increased mobility towards the anode .
<unk> derivatives of <unk> show higher distribution coefficients in the aqueous two-phase <unk> ( ethylene glycol ) system than do similar derivatives of glucagon .
acetylation decreases in parallel the ability of glucagon to stimulate the activity of adenylate cyclase and to bind to its receptors in liver cell membranes of the rat .
the biological potencies of the mono , di and <unk> derivates are , respectively , about 10 , 1 and 0.1 % that of native glucagon .
the binding properties of the material dissociated from the <unk> complex suggest that the reduction in biological activity results from a decrease in the intrinsic affinity of the modified glucagon for the receptors , as well as from the presence of small amounts of residual , unreacted glucagon .
studies with <unk> derivatives of glucagon indicate that acetylation decreases the rate of association and increases the rate of dissociation of the <unk> complex .
purification and properties of a periplasmic <unk> from escherichia coli .
a periplasmic <unk> from escherichia coli has been purified to <unk> .
it is a monomer of molecular weight 45000 and containing one -- sh group that is necessary for catalytic activity .
the study of its substrate specificity indicated that the enzyme has both aminopeptidase and endopeptidase activity .
the ph optimum for l-alanine <unk> hydrolysis is between 7 and 7.5 and that for <unk> casein proteolysis between 7.3 and 7.6 .
the activation energy for the hydrolysis of <unk> <unk> was calculated to be 5.3 kcal x <unk> ( 22.2 kj x <unk> ) .
the interaction of organic phosphates with human and chicken hemoglobin .
in this study of the binding properties of inositol <unk> and <unk> to chicken and human <unk> and carboxyhemoglobin were compared .
it appeared that in all cases the binding to chicken hemoglobin is much stronger than to human hemoglobin .
this is very probably due to the fact that 4 out of the 12 residues , responsible for the binding of phosphates in chicken hemoglobin , are <unk> .
these are absent in human hemoglobin , where the binding site is made up to only 8 residues .
for chicken hemoglobin one strong binding site could be observed in both <unk> and <unk> hemoglobin .
from these observations we conclude that the same binding site is involved in both the <unk> and <unk> structure showing different affinity to phosphates in the two conformational states .
for human hemoglobin we reached the same conclusion .
hepatic nucleases .
<unk> origin and association of neutral liver ribonuclease with lysosomes .
in the large granule fraction of rat liver , the density distribution of <unk> neutral ribonuclease is similar to that for acid hydrolases and its density distribution is similarly modified by triton <unk> accumulation in lysosomes .
particulate neutral ribonuclease is latent ; the enzyme is unmasked by very low <unk> concentrations or <unk> shock .
these observations demonstrate that the bulk of liver neutral ribonuclease is associated with the lysosomal system .
in view of the neutral ph optimum of the enzyme and of some particularities of its distribution in fractionation experiments , the <unk> of an <unk> origin of neutral ribonuclease has been investigated .
after partial <unk> , a significant decrease is observed in both plasma and liver neutral ribonuclease .
the effect is specific , for it does not occur for other lysosomal enzymes .
also , labelled bovine pancreatic ribonuclease , when injected intravenously , is taken up by the liver .
the <unk> labelled enzyme has a density distribution similar to the distribution of other foreign proteins , horseradish peroxidase or yeast <unk> .
these results are explained by the uptake of <unk> neutral ribonuclease from pancreatic origin by the liver .
glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes .
molecular weight , subunit composition and aggregation properties .
glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes exists <unk> as an entity of 100 000 molecular weight under various conditions of ph and ionic strength .
the s20 , w of 5.5 s and <unk> of 50 <unk> correlate with the molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium .
the homogeneity of this species is primarily dependent on the presence of thiols and secondarily on high concentrations of salt .
the amino-acid composition of the enzyme shows similarities both with glutathione reductases from other sources and with <unk> dehydrogenase .
from the flavin content and <unk> electrophoresis it is inferred that the native enzyme is a dimer composed of similar subunits of 50 000 molecular weight .
in the absence of thiols , glutathione reductase shows a tendency to form tetramers and larger aggregates .
although these larger species are also catalytically active , under cellular conditions the presence of its product , reduced glutathione , should maintain the enzyme as the dimeric entity .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> cortex .
isolation , catalytic properties and dissociation into two polypeptide chains .
<unk> <unk> was isolated from sheep kidney cortex as an apparently homogeneous , highly active protein .
at optimal ph and in the absence of acceptors , the enzyme catalyzes the release of about 510 <unk> of <unk> per mg protein per min from the model substrate <unk> .
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a sodium <unk> buffer system showed the presence of a large ( mr approximately <unk> ) and a small ( mr approximately 27000 ) polypeptide chain .
dissociation into two polypeptide chains was also achieved in 8 m urea .
<unk> with <unk> produced a crosslinked protein of molecular weight approximately <unk> .
in the course of this work a convenient procedure was developed for the determination of <unk> <unk> activity using l [ <unk> ] glutathione as the substrate .
in this procedure the release of <unk> [ <unk> ] glycine from glutathione is followed , after separation of the radioactive <unk> from unreacted glutathione on a small <unk> acetate column .
the reactions with <unk> and glutathione are both strongly activated by several metal ions ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) and by a number of amino acids and peptide acceptors .
the products of the reaction with glutathione were identified as <unk> , <unk> and glutamate .
the formation of these products is consistent with the function of <unk> <unk> in both the <unk> transfer reaction and in the hydrolysis of the <unk> bond .
the activating effect of metal ions in the reaction with glutathione was shown to be dependent on the acceleration of the transfer reaction ; the rate of hydrolysis of the <unk> bond remaining unchanged .
pyrophosphatase and <unk> in microsomal <unk> metabolism in the rat liver .
1. a radiochemical method for the studies on the microsomal <unk> acid metabolism has been developed .
2. the rat liver <unk> caused a rapid hydrolysis of <unk> acid to <unk> acid 1-phosphate and further although much slower to free <unk> acid .
in <unk> buffer ( ph 7.4 ) they were produced in ratio 72 : 1 .
no other metabolites were found in measurable amounts .
the pyrophosphatase splitting <unk> acid showed a ph optimum at 8.9 , but the liberation of <unk> acid from <unk> acid had two ph maxima ( ph 3.5 and 8.5 ) .
edta appeared to be less powerful inhibitor of pyrophosphatase than previously suggested .
about 25 per cent of the <unk> acid hydrolyzing activity was still remaining in the presence of 10 mm edta .
<unk> was found to have a slight inhibitory action on the pyrophosphatase activity .
citrate inhibited powerfully the hydrolysis of <unk> acid and the liberation of free <unk> acid .
phosphate was also inhibitory .
3. in the presence of an exogenous <unk> substrate , <unk> , the formation of <unk> acid 1-phosphate and free <unk> acid were slightly reduced , and <unk> acid 1-phosphate , <unk> and free <unk> acid were produced in ratio 78 : 23 : 1 .
when 10 mm edta was added to diminish the hydrolytic consumption of the <unk> donor substrate , the corresponding ratio was still as unfavorable as 19 : 2.6 : 1 .
the measurable activity of <unk> was lower in the presence of phosphate or citrate than in <unk> buffer , although they protected the <unk> donor substrate against hydrolysis .
<unk> the results indicate that even in the presence of added <unk> acceptor substrate the hydrolysis of <unk> acid predominates the conjugation in rat liver <unk> .
the rate of the hydrolysis of <unk> acid is quite considerable even in the presence of edta , and it is recommended to control the <unk> acid pyrophosphatase activity when <unk> and glucuronidation reactions are studied .
free <unk> acid appears to be produced from <unk> acid for further use via <unk> acid 1-phosphate , the rate-limiting step being the hydrolysis of this intermediate .
<unk> , <unk> of either endogenous or exogenous <unk> and <unk> have only a minor role in this respect in rat liver <unk> .
coupling of enzymes to <unk> .
incorporation of ( <unk> ) <unk> into phosphatidylcholine by plasma membranes of rat <unk> glands in vitro .
1. on incubation with the isolated rat <unk> gland plasma membranes , [ <unk> ] <unk> was incorporated mainly into phosphatidylcholine and hydrolysed to [ <unk> ] palmitic acid and <unk> .
2. the addition of <unk> enhanced the incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and lowered the hydrolysis of <unk> markedly .
3. in the presence of <unk> , <unk> incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was maximum at 0.1 mm <unk> , 0.5 mm <unk> and between ph 7.0 and <unk> 4 .
the incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was stimulated by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , inhibited by <unk> and <unk> and unaffected by sodium <unk> and atp .
5. epinephrine inhibited the incorporation of <unk> into phosphatidylcholine in the presence or absence of atp , the inhibition being more in the presence of atp than in its absence .
<unk> adenosine <unk> mimicked the inhibitory effect of epinephrine .
<unk> exchange of oxidized and reduced cytochrome c .
a comparison of mass spectrometry and infrared methods .
<unk> exchange in <unk> solutions of the two redox states of horse heart cytochrome c was investigated at 20 degrees c , ph 7 , by mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy .
mass spectrometry indicates that <unk> has 20 hydrogens <unk> after 24 h , 28 hydrogens exchanging between 10 min and 24 h , and 156 hydrogens exchanging within 10 min ; comparative values for <unk> are 45 , 19 and 140 .
the displacement of the exchange curves obtained by infrared corresponds to 8 to 9 peptide hydrogens .
these combined methods show many non-peptide hydrogens exchanging rapidly ( 87 and 79 for <unk> c and <unk> c respectively ) , whereas others , probably buried inside the molecule and involved in hydrogen bonds , are not exchanged , even after 24 h ( 14 and 30 hydrogens respectively , which is relatively large for a small protein ) .
infrared results are given in terms of changes of standard free energy for the <unk> reaction which exposes the peptide hydrogens to solvent : in <unk> c and <unk> c , 30 % and 40 % respectively of the peptide hydrogens are protected by conformational transitions stabilized by more than 5 kcal/mol ( 21 kj/mol ) , which implies a large increase in rigidity for the reduced form .
bacterial metabolism of <unk> compounds : purification and properties of <unk> hydroxylase and resorcinol hydroxylase from pseudomonas putida orc .
the hydroxylase activities observed in extracts of pseudomonas putida orc after growth on <unk> and resorcinol as sole source of carbon have been purified to homogeneity .
both enzymes were shown to be <unk> and to contain approximately 1 mol of fad for each polypeptide chain , s20 , w values for each enzyme are 4.1 <unk> 0.1 and are independent of the presence of their aromatic substrates .
molecular weight determinations under native ( approximately 68000 ) and denaturing ( approximately 70000 ) conditions indicated that they are monomeric .
the visible absorption spectra identical but the circular dichroic spectra of the two proteins can be distinguished .
although each protein catalyzes the nad ( p ) h and <unk> hydroxylation of both <unk> and resorcinol , the efficiency of the transformations of the substrates by the two enzymes is radically different ; furthermore resorcinol hydroxylase is much more versatile in the aromatic compounds it can utilize as substrates and effectors .
other properties of the enzymes which clearly establish their own identity include their serological characteristics and amino acid composition ; the latter property is particularly evident when the quantities of valine and alanine residues are compared .
the synthesis of each enzyme is also under different regulatory constraints , being controlled by the substrate used for growth .

[ possible <unk> organization of the system of local cerebral blood flow regulation ] .
<unk> under normal conditions in the rabbit , cat , and monkey brain was found to have a spontaneous periodicity while <unk> responses to afferent flicker stimulation usually revealed a <unk> <unk> pattern .
this suggests that the <unk> regulatory system consists of not less than two regulatory chains with different time constants , and a feedback .
the data on cerebral vascular responses to <unk> of <unk> solutions with various ph , potassium and catecholamines concentrations , suggest that rapid regulatory chains may be conditioned by potassium and neurogenic vascular effects , while slow ones could be mediated by co2 and related ph changes .
[ regulation of local tissue po2 in the cerebral cortex of the cat ] .
local po2 was measured in the cat cortex on adjacent sites with a platinum <unk> surface electrode both during steady state conditions and with varying arterial oxygen supply .
concomitantly , po2 in the sinus <unk> was recorded continuously through the vascular wall .
under <unk> and steady state conditions local tissue po2 values varied between o torr and almost arterial levels of 85 torr in accordance with theoretical calculations .
with increased arterial oxygen supply local tissue po2 as measured on <unk> sites was found to react fairly differently .
linear increases in local tissue po2 as compared with arterial po2 , as well as constant levels , or only very small increases , were recorded .
the constancy of local po2 ( = '' local po2 autoregulation '' ) was caused by local vasoconstriction .
with reduced supply of arterial oxygen , however , tissue po2 dropped in all studied sites down to hypoxia and anoxia .
po2 autoregulation during a decrease in arterial po2 , as described by bicher ( 1973 ) could not be found .
[ differences in the responses of taste receptors to organic and inorganic acids with changes in the concentration of bicarbonate in the solution ] .
the thresholds of the ph for citric acid ( <unk> ) were found to exceed by 1.4 ph the thresholds for <unk> ( 3.5 ) at 1.2 <unk> bicarbonate in the solution .
the reaction to citric acid was higher than to <unk> at equal ph .
decreasing of bicarbonate from 1.2 <unk> to 0 reduced ph threshold only for sitric acid from 4.90 to <unk> ph threshold for <unk> remained 3.5 the chorda tympani response to stimulation with solutions containing bicarbonate ( 1.2 <unk> ) was higher than in absence of bicarbonate .
the data obtained suggest two ranges of the acids in action .
[ indices of <unk> <unk> in dogs ] .
analysis of skin grafts across the <unk> in mice pretreated with sera from specifically or <unk> grafted donors .
prolonged survival of weakly incompatible skin allografts in mice ( across the barrier presented by the msa ) can be induced by <unk> the recipients not only with a specific <unk> serum ( obtained on day 5 after a single <unk> skin graft ) but also be means of control serum obtained in a similar way from the recipients of fully compatible ( <unk> ) skin grafts .
administration of serum from <unk> mice had no effect on graft survival .
the similar biological effect of both sera had a counterpart in their similar content and spectrum of glycosaminoglycans .
also in the skin grafts themselves , the course of both qualitative and quantitative changes of gag in the early <unk> period was in the allogeneic and <unk> situation similar .
the possible role of these substances in the serum and at the site of grafting and their effect on the outcome of the allograft response are discussed .
impaired sertoli cell function in experimental cryptorchidism in the rat .
the production of testicular <unk> protein ( abp ) , as a measure of sertoli cell function , was studied after unilateral or bilateral experimental cryptorchidism in adult rats .
two or 4 weeks after the testis had been translocated to the abdomen , no major changes were found in the concentration of abp per mg protein , although there was a marked and progressive decrease in abp content per testis .
however , the rate of abp production was greatly decreased , as measured by the accumulation of abp during <unk> ligation of the efferent ducts or by the production of abp by testis mince in an in vitro system .
this indicates that the sertoli cell function is severly impaired by the intra-abdominal position .

no evidence was then found to be in support of the still widely used restricted diet in the treatment of peptic ulcer .

the oxygen transport system of red blood cells during diabetic ketoacidosis and recovery .
daily evaluations of 8 newly detected <unk> diabetics showed the <unk> of haemoglobin to be decreased by 50 % while erythrocyte <unk> was decreased below 10 <unk> hb .
<unk> correlated strongly with ph during acidosis and with plasma inorganic phosphate ( pi ) subsequently to the first insulin administration .
oxygen affinity of haemoglobin , measured as p50 act ph , was unchanged in ketoacidosis compared to the time , however , p50 act ph fell striking ( p less than 0.001 ) and remained decreased up to 7 days depending upon the <unk> of <unk> in relation to pi .
the <unk> in reflecting the slope of the oxygen dissociation curve was diminished in ketoacidosis ( p less than 0.005 ) , and decreased further after <unk> ( p less than 0.005 ) .
there was a close association of n with <unk> ( p less than 0.001 ) and additionally with pi at <unk> below 10 <unk> hb .
based on these findings a decreased erythrocyte oxygen release of one fifth during acidosis and more than one third after <unk> can be hypothesised .
in view of the intimate relation of pi to the oxygen transport system it is <unk> that treatment of ketoacidosis should include <unk> .
fluorescence of oxidized <unk> from <unk> isolated pancreatic islets .
in <unk> pancreatic islets , the fluorescence of oxidized <unk> ( fad ) was recorded continuously .

<unk> ( 10 mm ) , ( <unk> ) <unk> ( 20 mm ) and <unk> acid ( 10 mm ) caused typical kinetics of <unk> decrease .
the results are interpreted to indicate rapid changes of the functional state of b-cell mitochondria induced by the above-mentioned stimulators of insulin release .

comparison of amino acids bathing the <unk> gland area in the stimulation of gastric secretion .
this study was undertaken to compare the ability of <unk> and <unk> of amino acids bathing the <unk> gland area to stimulate acid secretion in conscious dogs with <unk> pouch ( hp ) , gastric fistula ( gf ) and pancreatic fistula ( pf ) .
acid outputs from hp were determined by an <unk> titration method when amino acid solutions were perfused into hp at various concentrations , ph values , and distention pressures .
only <unk> of all natural amino acids were found to stimulate acid secretion , whereas <unk> of amino acids tested were completely inert in this respect .
the comparison of the <unk> activity of amino acids shows that <unk> among essential amino acids and glycine among nonessential amino acids exhibited the strongest stimulation of acid outputs , reaching , respectively , 52 and 40 % of the maximal response to histamine .
decreasing the ph of <unk> solution perfused into hp in sequential order from 5.0 to 1.0 resulted in a stepwise reduction of acid output , falling at ph 1.0 to about 40 % of the peak response achieved at ph 5.0 .
local irrigation of hp by 2 % <unk> and intravenous infusion of atropine ( 100 mug per kg per hr ) or <unk> ( 2.9 mg per kg per hr ) reduced but did not abolish hp response to chemical stimulation and the ph dependency of this response .
we conclude that only <unk> and not <unk> of amino acids bathing the <unk> gland area stimulate acid secretion by a local , <unk> mechanism sensitive to distention pressure and ph .
evidence of tandem duplication of genes in a <unk> region of pneumococcal mutants resistant to sulfonamide .
a pneumococcal mutant , <unk> , resistant to sulfonamides , and three <unk> bearing associated d or <unk> resistance markers have earlier been reported to be unstable and show distinct patterns and frequencies of segregating stable progeny lacking the c marker .
each of the four strains showed a characteristic dosage of the genes involved in the <unk> .
complementary strands of <unk> from these stable and unstable strains were resolved and <unk> and <unk> hybrids made from the separated dna strands were used as donors in genetic transformations .
activities of a normal marker ( streptomycin resistance ) and those involved in the heterozygosity ( c , d and <unk> ) were quantitatively measured .
from those <unk> made up of opposite strands derived from a heterozygote and a stable strain , the normal marker is transferred efficiently , but the heterozygous markers are not .
on the other hand , if both strands of a <unk> are derived from different <unk> strains , all markers can be transferred with usual efficiency to a stable recipient strain .
the lowered efficiency in the former type of <unk> is attributed to an <unk> resulting from a tandem duplication in the <unk> strains , and a postulated dna repair process stimulated by it while in the form of the donor duplex .
the <unk> probably includes ( a ) a <unk> between the c site and the wild type locus , and ( b ) a more extensive incompatibility attributable to an extra segment of genome in a tandem duplication covering the c and d sites .
the first of these <unk> produces a lowered efficiency of transfer from all configurations of the particular d allele associated with the mutant c marker , and therefore accounts for the characteristic transfer patterns even from the native <unk> <unk> .
a study of pneumococcal <unk> at the molecular level .
the dna of a <unk> pneumococcal strain ( heterozygous for <unk> ) and that of three highly resistant and persistently heterozygous cd <unk> , derived by introducing <unk> marker into a stable sulfonamide resistant strain ( <unk> ) , were studied to analyze the genetic basis of their <unk> .
the physical properties of the native and denatured dna from the heterozygotes and the <unk> strains were not distinguishable .
the <unk> and the <unk> of biological activity for the heterozygous markers were essentially identical to those of the normal markers .
the heterozygosity extends to the closely linked locus giving rise to four different configurations of cd and <unk> <unk> , characterized by their frequencies of segregation and <unk> activities .
the <unk> ratios and the frequency of <unk> of heterozygous markers were found to remain the same in each when the donor dna was native , denatured or <unk> without fractionation or <unk> after remixing of resolved strands .
possible models were weighed against these observations and these considerations led to the suggestion that tandem duplication of a gene region may be responsible for the heterozygosity and instability of this region .
a more detailed examination of this model will be presented in an accompanying paper .
genetic hybridization at the unlinked thy and str loci of streptococcus .
the <unk> and pneumoniae species of streptococcus were used as recipients in transformations from <unk> to <unk> and from <unk> to <unk> .
the <unk> mutations in the two species had been previously shown to be allelic .
homology of the <unk> mutations in the two species was demonstrated in the similar phenotypic properties they conferred ( death in the absence of thymidine , lack of thymidylate synthetase ) .
the str and thy loci are unlinked in each <unk> -- - when the two species are transformed by both <unk> and <unk> dna , the efficiency is always lower in the <unk> cross .
the efficiency of <unk> transformation is considerably lower at the thy than at the str locus .
dna was extracted from recipients that had integrated markers of <unk> origin .
when such hybrid dna is tested on the original recipient species , the <unk> markers are usually as efficient as <unk> markers .
when tested on the original donor species , however , the hybrid dna is usually more efficient than <unk> dna .
this is true for both thy and str transformation .
-- -- forty independent <unk> hybrids were obtained in the cross of <unk> <unk> recipients with pneumoniae <unk> dna .
these hybrids fall into a number of classes based upon the relative efficiency with which their extracted <unk> are able to transfer the <unk> marker into pneumoniae <unk> cells .
the most efficient of these <unk> exhibits about 20 % of the efficiency of <unk> pneumoniae <unk> dna and three orders of magnitude greater efficiency than <unk> <unk> <unk> dna .
thus , very little of the inefficiency of <unk> transformation of the thy locus is <unk> to a classic restriction mechanism .
rather , the wild-type <unk> loci in the two species appear to differ at multiple sites , and independent <unk> transfers result in differential extents of integration of these sites .
on this basis , the <unk> loci of the two species differ at a greater number of sites than do the respective <unk> loci .

thefts without motive of pain have been known since the early 19th century .
but the problem has not been solved .
while they were formerly considered a mental disease , today they are not seen as something special .
but they still happen .
only a small percentage of common <unk> can be called a <unk> syndrome .
many explanations and analyses have been published which are discussed in detail .
in a group described here comprehensively difficult marital situations full of conflict , marital sexual frustration , depression , physical and mental exhaustion and aggressive and suicidal tendencies are found .
theft appears to be closely connected with these .
but the pattern of motivation and causation is by no means <unk> .
in order to clear up such actions one will have to consider as exactly as possible the biographic connection and what happens during the act - quite apart from somatic conditions .
present assessment in reports is totally unsatisfactory .
to clear up the controversial questions is urgently necessary .
the structures of the phytochrome chromophore in both <unk> forms .
spectral measurements of phytochrome are performed after unfolding of the peptide chain .
by comparison with bile pigments of known structure , structure 1a , containing a hydrogenated ring a , is deduced for the pr chromophore .
its spectral properties indicate that the chromophore of the physiologically active pfr form has lost the double bond of the bridge joining rings a and b .
a <unk> for quantitative determination of <unk> acids from erythrocyte membranes .
a <unk> is presented which enables the fast and exact determination of <unk> <unk> acids in erythrocyte membranes .
erythrocytes from 1 ml of human and rabbit blood containing acd buffer are , washed and <unk> on millipore filters of pore size 1.2 mu .
<unk> acids are released from the erythrocyte membranes still on the filters under the optimal conditions of 0.1 n hcl at 80 degrees c for 50 min .
a prerequisite for the determination of the true amount of <unk> acids using the periodic <unk> acid assay is the small-scale extraction of lipids from the hydrolysate and <unk> chromatography of <unk> acids .
the values thus obtained must be corrected , as 20 % of <unk> acids are destroyed during acid hydrolysis .
in samples of human blood from 10 healthy individuals , on an average 223 <unk> <unk> acids per ml of packed erythrocytes were found , and in the same amount of rabbit erythrocytes , 1e method for a screening of the <unk> acid content of erythrocyte membranes in hemolytic diseases or of other cell membranes is discussed .
human liver acid phosphatases .
human liver contains three <unk> distinct forms of non-specific acid phosphatase ( ec <unk> ) .
acid phosphatases i , ii and iii have molecular weights of greater than 200 000 , of 107 000 , and of 13 400 , respectively .
following partial purification , isoenzyme ii was obtained as a single activity band , as assessed by activity staining with <unk> phosphate and <unk> phosphate on polyacrylamide gels run at several ph values .
with 50mm <unk> phosphate as a substrate , enzymes ii and iii exhibit plateaus of activity over the ph range 3 - 5 and 3.5 - 6 , respectively .
acid phosphatase ii is not significantly inhibited by 0.5 % formaldehyde .
the activity of human liver acid phosphatase ii and of human prostatic acid phosphatase towards several substrates is compared .
the liver enzyme , is marked contrast to the prostatic enzyme , does not hydrolyze <unk> choline .
isolation and characterization of <unk> type iii collagen from calf skin .
calf skin collagen was <unk> by incubating <unk> calf skin with pepsin at ph 2.0 and 25 degrees c , conditions that did not cause degradation of the triple helical region of collagen .
type iii collagen was separated from type i collagen by differential salt precipitation at ph 7.5 .
the isolated type iii collagen contained mainly gamma and higher molecular weight components cross-linked by reducible and/or <unk> bonds .
the isolated <unk> ( iii ) chains had an amino acid composition characteristic of type iii collagen .
denatured but unreduced type iii collagen , <unk> on <unk> , eluted in the alpha 2 region , while after reduction and alkylation the <unk> ( iii ) chains eluted between the positions of <unk> ( i ) and <unk> .
the <unk> melting temperature temperature ( tm ) of type iii collagen ( 35.1 degrees c ) in a citrate buffer at ph 3.7 was somewhat lower than that of type i collagen ( 35.9 degrees c ) .
<unk> experiments at 25 degrees c showed that denatured type iii collagen molecules with intact intramolecular disulfide bridges ( gamma components ) reform the triple helical structure of collagen much faster than reduced and <unk> <unk> ( iii ) chains .
<unk> and versatile drug therapy with treatment-resistant psychotic patients .
the author believes that many of the chronic patients in psychiatric institutions and mental health facilities could be helped if physicians were more willing to try different combinations and higher dosages of psychotropic drugs than are commonly used .
he presents case studies of two chronic patients who were helped by innovative use of drugs and discusses factors to be considered in implementing <unk> and versatile drug therapy .

a new variant of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase deficiency is described .
the enzyme kinetics and properties were studied .
genetic and electrophoretic data pointed to a double heterozygous state in the patient .

[ infusion treatment in shock ] .
nowadays , above all dextran , gelatin and starch solutions are available for the infusion <unk> of the various forms of shock .
the application of these volume substitutes must be strictly controlled to avoid in particular <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
blood transfusion combined with a volume substitute should only be applied in cases of heavy loss of blood .
the treatment of metabolic <unk> which usually occurs simultaneously is carried out with an alkaline solution .
suppressor t cells and host resistance to tye 111 pneumococcus after treatment with <unk> serum .
the antibody response to type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide ( <unk> ) was significantly increased in mice treated with <unk> serum ( als ) .
<unk> mice given 0.25 ml of als on days -1 , 0 , and 1 relative to the days of immunization with 0.5 mug of <unk> had a 20-fold increment ( <unk> increased to <unk> ) in the number of splenic <unk> cells enumerated on day 5 compared with untreated , immunized controls .
this effect has been attributed to the elimination of subpopulation of <unk> lymphocytes ( t cells ) that has suppressor function .
the present series of experiments relate the augmented antibody response to <unk> in mice treated with als to increased host resistance after infection with streptococcus pneumoniae , type iii ( <unk> ) .
the 50 % lethal dose of <unk> in <unk> mice was 102 and the 100 % lethal dose was 103 organisms .
mice immunized with 0.5 mug of <unk> and challenged 5 days later with <unk> were completely protected against a dose of up to 108 organisms .
mice treated with 0.25 ml of als on days -1 , 0 , and 1 , immunized with <unk> on day 0 , and challenged with 2.5 x 10 ( 9 ) <unk> on day 5 had a mean survival time of greater than 100 h compared with 16 h for immunized <unk> controls .
animals given a single injection of als before immunization showed no increase in resistance , whereas mice treated after immunization had significant prolongation of survival times .
untreated , immunized mice challenged with 5 x 10 ( 9 ) , 1 x 5 x 10 ( 8 ) <unk> survived 14 to 19 h , whereas <unk> animals had mean survival times of 48 , 174 , and 222 h , respectively .
these findings suggest that <unk> t cells may have a biologically significant effect in a narrow zone in which the normal host immune response is insufficient but still potentially capable of providing some additional degree of protection if suppressor cells are <unk> .
[ past and present aspects of diarrheal disease in <unk> clinical study and treatment ( <unk> transl ) ] .
the etiologic and <unk> findings described in the first part of this paper have important consequences : the recognition of the specific etiology of diarrhea requires new laboratory methods : most of these , however , are technically easy to perform and do not require a large laboratory .
a <unk> consequence of this changed concept is a well-founded modification of therapy .
the most important discovery was , that in a well balanced glucose electrolyte solution sodium and glucose enhance their absorption mutually and increase the absorption of water by solvent drag .
since in most acute <unk> the mechanisms of absorption of glucose and electrolytes are retained this mechanism can be utilized for fast oral rehydration and reinstitution of normal intestinal homeostasis .
prompt institution of a diet consisting of the previously mentioned <unk> solution usually prevents severe dehydration and the need for stationary treatment .
the elimination of lactose and long chain fatty acids from the diet prevents continuation of the pathologic osmotic and chemical conditions in the intestine .
antibiotics are not indicated in acute diarrhea with the exception of diarrhea caused by <unk> e .

population <unk> menace to what ?
originally , many of the initiators of the world population conference , which took place in bucharest in 1974 , had hoped that the conference would imply a final breakthrough for the view that family planning measures should be given top priority in all less-developed countries .
in fact , however , the plan of action passed by the conference contains very little relating to population and family planning .
instead , the document is dominated by wordy phrases about the necessity of attaining social and economic development in those countries .
will the insight that family planning programs work efficiently only if they are an integral part of programs for the social and economic development of a country lead to such programs being realized ?
there is every reason to doubt that the plan of action will have any such effect .
the reasons for the underdevelopment of third world countries can not be removed through such united nations resolutions .
in the <unk> republic of china , family planning is widely accepted , especially in the towns , and now also among the rural population .
limiting the number of children is considered part of <unk> development effort .
china is a less-developed country that is in the process of rapid social and economic development .
the issue at stake in other third world countries is how to achieve a similar development .
as soon as this goal is achieved , family planning efforts are meaningful and have a chance of success .
the experience of china demonstrates that even there it took time before the efforts succeeded .
there are many third world countries that could , without much difficulty , support a population considerably larger than the present one .
but there are no doubt also a number of countries where the population is already so large that a continued population increase would be harmful .
the need to achieve rapid development becomes increasingly urgent , not in the least to make it possible to attain a reduced population growth .
the sad truth is that so little development takes place in those countries .
without social and economic development , the present rapid population increase will continue in those countries where there is already an overly dense population .
training of the barefoot doctor in the <unk> republic of china : from prevention to curative service .
among the changes that have been brought about in health delivery in the <unk> republic of china , the introduction of the barefoot doctor has been one of the most important and effective ways that the government has devised to radically alter the concept of health care .
through close identification with the community in terms of recruitment , training , and practice , the barefoot doctor is a concrete manifestation of the ideological principles of following the mass line and being self-reliant .
the paper focuses on the building of rural health services , with special reference to the training of the barefoot doctor as the first-level contact person in primary care in the communes .
it describes the training programs in a school of public health and the career mobility possible to the barefoot doctor in joining the ranks of medical practitioners .
effect of the <unk> blocking agent <unk> on the action of coumarin .
in a double-blind study , the influence of <unk> on the effect of anticoagulant therapy with <unk> was examined .
in comparison to a placebo group , neither any influence on the quick time , nor any increased tendency to haemorrhage bleeding could be detected .

investigations of the excretion of <unk> into the urine .
the excretion of the enzyme <unk> and its isoenzymes into the urine was investigated in patients with renal diseases and compared with the excretion of the enzymes <unk> and <unk> .
in animal experiments an increased excretion of these enzymes was found after <unk> .
increased excretion of <unk> was also found in patients with glomerulonephritis and in the <unk> phase of acute tubular necrosis , but not in cases of pyelonephritis and in the <unk> phase of acute tubular necrosis .
the alterations of the isoenzyme pattern during diseases with increased enzyme excretion are in accordance with the hypothesis that the enzymes are liberated from the kidney tissue into the urine , and only a minority stems from the blood .
investigation of the excretion of <unk> and its isoenzymes into the urine seems to be of both scientific and clinical interest .
interaction of adrenergic antagonists with prostaglandin e2 and tetrahydrocannabinol in the eye .
both <unk> and beta-adrenergic antagonists have been utilized in an <unk> to discern the site of action of prostaglandin ( pg ) and tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) in the eye .
both <unk> and beta-adrenergic antagonists ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> , propranolol and <unk> ) <unk> a dose-dependent reduction in intraocular pressure and blood pressure and increased total outflow facility .
the results are consistent with the concept that both <unk> and beta-adrenergic receptors are present in the anterior uvea and that vasomotor tone is essential to the maintenance of normal intraocular pressure .
no antagonist reduced the <unk> elevation of intraocular pressure unless the blood pressure was severely lowered .
all antagonists inhibit the normal <unk> increase in total outflow facility , indicating that these agents protect the <unk> barrier from breakdown without altering the <unk> response to pg .
all antagonists reduced the fall in intraocular pressure produced by thc by approximately 50 per cent , except for <unk> which completely abolished the intraocular pressure fall .
only the <unk> antagonists prevented the <unk> increase in total outflow facility .
the results indicate that true outflow facility may well be regulated exclusively by <unk> .
the data are consistent with the effect of thc being primarily a vasodilation of the efferent blood vessels of the anterior uvea .
the partial inhibition by <unk> antagonists may also suggest a lesser role of thc on the afferent vessels .
induction of corneal graft rejection by passive cell transfer .
an experimental model is presented demonstrating that penetrating corneal grafts in the rabbit may be rejected by passive transfer into the anterior chamber of specifically sensitized lymphoid cells .
destruction of <unk> corneal endothelium is always marked by the formation of focal <unk> areas of damage in this system , rather than by the typical moving line of rejecting endothelium usually seen in spontaneous graft rejection .
where the transferred lymphoid cells are compatible with the tissues of the graft recipient , the picture is one of a severely affected graft on a field of uninvolved recipient corneal endothelium .
where the lymphoid cells are compatible with the graft and not with the tissues of the recipient , one sees a clear corneal graft surviving on a field of endothelial destruction on the recipient bed .
the specificity of these reactions is illustrated in terms of the histocompatibility relationships between corneal donor , graft recipient , and the donor of the sensitized lymphoid cells .
acute tubular necrosis .
an experimental model detailing the biochemical events accompanying renal injury and recovery .
male charles river mice , divided into control or experimental groups , received on day 0 either sterile 0.3 <unk> in 0.9 per cent saline ( <unk> ) intraperitoneal injection or <unk> acid ( 200 mug per body weight ) , similarly buffered to <unk> , and were sacrificed on days 0 , 1/4 , 1/2 , <unk> , and 14 .
the experimental kidneys demonstrated <unk> deposits of <unk> acid with edema between days 1 and 4 with cortical scarring by day 14 .
the experimental kidneys reached maximal increases in weight ( +90 per cent ) on day 2 , rna ( <unk> per cent , protein ( +67 per cent ) on day 3 , and dna ( +25 per cent ) on day 4 before falling to below control levels on day 14 .
the control kidneys demonstrated the gradual incremental increases of normal renal growth throughout this period .
no change in renal size , protein , rna , or dna could be detected in those animals who failed to demonstrate renal tubular damage .
it is postulated that the response of the kidney to folic acid administration is a reparative response and not a response directed toward accelerated renal growth .

properties of the <unk> transport system in <unk> <unk> .
transport of <unk> ( <unk> ) by <unk> <unk> cells was studied .
the <unk> transport system appeared to be constitutive in cells grown on <unk> and glucose ; the transport process depended on the concentration of substrate used and exhibited typical saturation kinetics , with an apparent km of 4.6 mum .
<unk> was transported as a free carbohydrate and was not metabolized further in the cell .
dependence on ph and temperature and the results of efflux and `` <unk> '' experiments demonstrated the carrier nature of the transport system .
<unk> and glucose competitively inhibited <unk> transport , whereas maltose inhibited in <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> sulfonate , <unk> , and <unk> inhibited transport of <unk> .
cells were able to accumulate <unk> against a concentration gradient .
some electron transfer inhibitors ( rotenone and <unk> ) , arsenate , <unk> , and proton conductors such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , pentachlorophenol , and <unk> inhibited this process .
starvation survival of salmonella enteritidis .
washed cells of salmonella enteritidis harvested from a defined medium during logarithmic growth were subjected to starvation in ph 7 phosphate buffer at 37 c .
viability was measured by slide cultures and plate counts .
the survival of cell suspensions equivalent to 1 to 10 mg ( dry wt ) <unk> was influenced by cryptic growth .
the rate of cryptic growth , assessed by plate counts , increased with cell density and could not be alleviated by starvation with dialysis .
dialysis of the starving culture did retard the onset of cryptic growth but did not eliminate it , indicating that the major substrates for regrowth were relatively large cellular components .
in phosphate buffer , 6.7 homologous <unk> cells allowed for the doubling of one s. enteritidis cell .
cryptic growth was not observed when cells were starved on the surface of membrane filters or in suspensions equivalent to 20 mug ( dry wt ) <unk> ( 105 <unk> ) .
similar half-life survival times were calculated for both these populations , but the shape of their survival curves differed significantly .
these differences were attributed to stress factors encountered during cell preparation and during starvation .
the half-life survival time of s. enteritidis starved at 20 mug ( dry wt ) <unk> was 140 h in phosphate buffer , 82 h in <unk> , <unk> acid buffer , and 77 h in tris ( hydroxymethyl ) <unk> buffer .
mismatch correction in pneumococcal transformation : donor length and <unk> marker efficiency .
a hypothesis that preferential rejection of donor markers by the hex system of pneumococcus is due to lethal double-strand breaks has been examined in terms of its implications for the extent of the excision required .
experiments reported here were directed at asking whether <unk> marker efficiency depends on the length of the donor deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) .
in the absence of intracellular competition for hex function , there was no detectable effect of dna size on <unk> marker efficiency as donor dna was sheared from greater than 1 x 107 daltons to 3.6 x 105 daltons .
the latter dna was purified by two successive velocity <unk> to ensure that the activity seen was representative of dna of that size .
quantitative examination of the system shows that , for the lethal event hypothesis to be true , the excision step has to remove an average of 7,000 to 10,000 nucleotides .
this figure is so much greater than that seen in other excision processes that alternate hypotheses should be considered .
the presently known properties of the hex system can be accounted for by a model invoking the migratory features of type i restriction enzymes .
<unk> study of the anaerobic growth of escherichia coli : growth <unk> in a synthetic medium .
a <unk> technique was used for studying the growth of escherichia coli during <unk> .
the growth <unk> obtained are complex and the shape of curves is dependent on the hydrogen lyase activity of the cells .
fermentation balances are given for different culture conditions , and simple growth <unk> are obtained when the hydrogen lyase activity is <unk> .
physiological study of ergot : induction of alkaloid synthesis by tryptophan at the enzymatic level .
the enhancement of ergot alkaloid production by tryptophan and its analogues in both normal and <unk> cultures is more directly related to increased <unk> ( <unk> ) synthetase activity rather than to a lack of regulation of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes .
<unk> [ <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> ] is rather ineffective in the end product regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis , whereas tryptophan and <unk> are potent effectors .
the presence of increased levels of <unk> synthetase in ergot cultures supplemented with tryptophan or <unk> , and to a lesser extent with <unk> , suggests that the induction effect involves de novo synthesis of the enzyme .
<unk> and tryptophan but not <unk> can overcome the block of alkaloid synthesis by inorganic phosphate .
the results with <unk> indicate that the phosphate effect can not be explained merely on the basis of a block of tryptophan synthesis .
<unk> study of the anaerobic growth of escherichia coli : measurements of the affinity of whole cells for various energy substrates .
<unk> has been used to determine the affinity of whole cells of escherichia coli for glucose , galactose , fructose , and lactose .
anaerobic growth <unk> were analyzed , and the km and vmax values for these energy substrates were measured at ph 7.8 .
results obtained with this technique using various organisms growing anaerobically on different sugars are compared .
this comparison shows that in practically all cases the cellular rate of catabolic activity is a hyperbolic function of the energy substrate concentrations at low sugar concentrations .
in some cases this technique also allows determination of kinetics at high sugar concentrations .
purification and properties of polyol dehydrogenase from <unk> <unk> .
a polyol dehydrogenase of broad specificity was purified <unk> from extracts of the filamentous fungus <unk> <unk> .
the enzyme was found to act as an <unk> in two <unk> systems : <unk> ( or xylitol ) <unk> dinucleotide ( nad ) and <unk> adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( nadp ) .
the dehydrogenase was composed of five isozymes , which , as a mixture , exhibited these properties : km to <unk> and <unk> , 7.15 to 10 ( -2 ) m ; ph optimum , 9 to 10 ; molecular weight , 300,000 subunit weight , 29,000 ; pi , 5.8 to 7.5 .
the <unk> activity was labile to treatment with heat or <unk> acid .
mixed substrate assays support the hypothesis that both <unk> , and <unk> activities are associated with isozymes of a single dehydrogenase .
effect of alkali on the structure of cell envelopes of chlamydia <unk> elementary bodies .
suspensions of isolated cell envelopes of infectious elementary bodies ( eb ) of chlamydia <unk> at alkaline ph showed a rapid , extensive decrease in absorbance , accompanied by the release of a cell envelope component in a <unk> form .
this phenomenon was observed both at 0 c and with envelopes which had been previously heated to 100 c .
monovalent and divalent cations effectively inhibited the turbidity loss , whereas <unk> ( edta ) caused an accelerated decrease in turbidity .
the turbidity loss observed after incubation of the envelopes at alkaline ph could be reversed to the level of the initial value by dialysis against distilled water containing <unk> .
<unk> electron <unk> of purified eb exposed to alkaline buffer with edta revealed the loss of the internal contents of cells , but these cells still maintained their round shapes .
the cell surface of treated eb appeared pitted in negatively stained preparations , whereas intact eb had a smooth surface .
electron microscopic studies on negatively stained preparations of the clear supernatant obtained after the treatment of the envelope with alkaline buffer containing edta demonstrated the presence of spherical particles , approximately 6 to 7 nm in diameter , and <unk> particles , which appeared to be made up of two or more spherical particles .
<unk> complex isolated from the cell envelopes of chlamydia <unk> in alkaline buffer and <unk> .
exposure of isolated cell envelopes from purified infectious elementary ( eb ) of chlamydia <unk> to sodium <unk> buffer at ph 10 plus <unk> ( edta ) results in partial <unk> of the total protein .
the released materials represent 20 % of the dry weight , 16 % of the total protein , 40 % of the total carbohydrate , and 9 % of the total lipid of the cell envelopes .
sucrose density gradient centrifugation , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> 4b , or <unk> column chromatography , reveal a <unk> complex of several hundred thousand molecular weight that contains 50 % protein .
sodium dodecyl <unk> gel electrophoresis of the isolated eb cell envelopes reveals two major protein bands , a and b , with estimated molecular masses of approximately 85,000 and 53,000 , respectively , both of which also stain for the presence of carbohydrate and lipid .
gel electrophoresis of the <unk> complex reveals two protein bands , c and d , with estimated molecular weights of approximately 17,000 and 13,000 , respectively , which contain lipid and a small amount of carbohydrate ; bands a and b are not present in the complex .
gel electrophoresis of the cell envelope residues after extraction of the complex with alkali and edta shows a single main band , corresponding to the position of band b , which contains protein , carbohydrate , and lipid ; band a is completely missing .
b and a is believed to be a component of the complex , which is split into two subunits on alkali <unk> .
purification and properties of <unk> from escherichia coli .
<unk> ( ec <unk> ) has been purified from escherichia coli k-12 to near homogeneity based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in both 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate and in 6 m urea at ph 8.5 .
the purified enzyme shows a ph optimum of 7.7 and the km for <unk> is 0.43 mm .
the molecular weight of this enzyme , determined by both <unk> gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis , is equivalent to 36,000 .
it is shown to be a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme .
studies on the substrate <unk> of the purified enzyme indicate that this enzyme is an <unk> .
acid protease activity during germination of <unk> of the cellular slime mold <unk> pallidum .
extracts of dormant <unk> of <unk> pallidum demonstrate ph optima for the hydrolysis of casein at 3.5 and 6.0 .
during germination the intracellular ph 6.0 <unk> specific activity does not change significantly .
the ph 6.0 protease is also active on <unk> , revealing the same developmental pattern with this substrate .
both acid protease activities are excreted during the germination process .
addition of purified nonspecific protease to cultures speeds up germination , suggesting that the excreted protease may play a role in removal of the <unk> wall .
when <unk> is added to cultures , complete germination ( emergence ) is stopped whereas the ph 6.0 protease activity still accumulates to between 50 and 60 % of the maximum control activity .
although this suggests that post-translational controls might mediate the accumulation of a portion of the ph 6.0 protease increase , mixing and dilution experiments with cell extracts do not reveal the differential presence of soluble activators or inhibitors of this activity at different developmental stages .
the presence of tightly bound <unk> complexes for protease b in dormant <unk> has not been ruled out and is currently under study .
altered nutritional requirements associated with mutations affecting the structures of ribonucleic acid polymerase in lactobacillus casei .
<unk> mutants were isolated from lactobacillus casei s1 and examined for possible simultaneous alteration in nutritional properties .
among the 36 mutants obtained either spontaneously or after mutagenesis with <unk> , 22 were found to be altered with respect to the specific growth requirements .
the majority ( 20 of 22 ) of the latter mutants were shown to require l-glutamine in addition to the nutrients required by the parental strain for maximal growth , whereas the remaining mutants had apparently lost the requirement for <unk> .
further studies with one of the <unk> mutants revealed that the rifampin resistance of this strain is due to the resistance of ribonucleic acid polymerase itself and that a single mutation is responsible for both rifampin resistance and the glutamine requirement .
these results strongly indicate that a structural alteration of the ribonucleic acid polymerase caused by the rifampin resistance mutation somehow affected glutamine metabolism , possibly through change in selective transcription of the genes involved .
preparations and properties of ribonucleic acid polymerase from acinetobacter <unk> .
deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) <unk> ribonucleic acid ( rna ) polymerase ( ec <unk> ) from acinetobacter <unk> was purified to apparent homogeneity and its properties were compared with those of the escherichia coli b enzyme .
the molecular weights of the two native active enzymes as well as their alpha and beta subunits appeared to be similar .
no subunit corresponding to that of sigma from e. coli was found , and furthermore no separation between the beta subunits could be detected by gel electrophoresis .
a number of different dnas were transcribed by the enzyme from a. <unk> .
maximal rna synthesis occurred at ph 8.7 , 10 mm <unk> , or 0.3 mm <unk> and at a total ionic strength of 0.1 .
higher ionic strengths led to increasing inhibition of transcription and at mu = 0.4 complete inhibition was observed .
the mechanism of inhibition of salt was not related to the initiation event as observed with t4 core rna polymerase ( <unk> , 1975 ) .
in an attempt to understand the mechanism of inhibition by salt , the effect of ionic strength on the sedimentation properties of the enzyme was investigated .
at low ionic strength , enzyme species with sedimentation coefficients , s20 , w , of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were present .
in buffers with higher ionic strengths the relative amounts of the <unk> species decreased .
it is suggested , therefore , that the inhibition of activity at higher salt concentrations is caused by a decrease in concentration of the active enzyme species .
<unk> activity of a <unk> mycoplasma : <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> activity of a <unk> mycoplasma was studied in experiments using whole cells and cell-free enzyme preparations by measuring the release of <unk> from [ 14c ] urea .
under the conditions used , the urea concentration optimum is approximately 5.6 x 10 ( -3 ) m urea .
the activity is soluble and not membrane bound .
it is stable at -70 c for several weeks but is more labile at higher temperatures .
the ph optimum is between 5.0 and 6.0 .
the effect of several inhibitors on the activity was tested and revealed similarities , as well as differences , between <unk> mycoplasma urease activity and the urease activity of other organisms and plants .
arginine decarboxylase from a pseudomonas species .
an arginine decarboxylase has been isolated from a pseudomonas species .
the enzyme is constitutive and did not appear to be repressed by a variety of carbon sources .
after an approximately 40-fold purification , the enzyme appeared more similar in its properties to the escherichia coli biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase than to the e. coli inducible ( <unk> ) enzyme .
the pseudomonas arginine decarboxylase exhibited a ph optimum of 8.1 and an absolute requirement of <unk> and pyridoxal phosphate , and was inhibited significantly at lower <unk> concentrations by the polyamines putrescine , spermidine , and <unk> .
the km for l-arginine was about 0.25 mm at ph 8.1 and 7.2 .
the enzyme was completely inhibited by <unk> .
the inhibition was prevented by <unk> , a feature that suggests the involvement of an <unk> group .
of a variety of labeled amino acids tested , only l-arginine , but not <unk> was decarboxylated .
<unk> was a potent inhibitor of arginine decarboxylase with a ki of 3.2 mum .
<unk> of certain aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes of escherichia coli k-12 by growth in <unk> medium .
<unk> acid <unk> synthase , <unk> dehydratase , tryptophan synthase , and <unk> synthase enzyme activities are <unk> in wild-type escherichia coli k-12 cells grown on <unk> medium .
this <unk> is reversed when <unk> is added to the growth medium .
addition of shikimic acid to the <unk> growth medium caused repression of the first three enzyme activities but not of <unk> synthase activity .
addition of <unk> acid to the <unk> growth medium has no effect on any of the above-mentioned enzyme activities .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> acid <unk> synthase activity is due to an elevation of the <unk> isoenzyme ; the <unk> isoenzyme is not <unk> under these conditions .
control of differentiation in <unk> : involvement of <unk> deoxyribonucleic acid and glucose repression in aerial mycelia development .
when streptomyces <unk> spores were grown in <unk> broth containing 5 mum ethidium bromide , a high frequency of permanently cured aerial <unk> ( <unk> ) colonies was recovered .
the appearance an <unk> colonies was time dependent : a very low frequency ( 0.3 % ) at zero time , a maximum ( 9 to 21 % ) after 2 to 5 days of growth , and a decline again to low frequencies later in the growth cycle .
on agar , cured <unk> colonies of s. <unk> still produced <unk> .
the development of aerial mycelia in s. <unk> , s. scabies , and s. <unk> was also sensitive to glucose repression .
colonies grown on <unk> agar containing 2 % glucose remained phenotypically <unk> throughout the observation period .
adenine ( 2.5 mm or greater ) , and to a lesser extent adenosine and guanosine , specifically reversed the repression .
the accumulation of <unk> organic acids appears to be involved in glucose repression of aerial mycelia formation .
however , this does not appear to be the case with <unk> production in s. <unk> ; glucose repression was observed over the ph range 5.0 to 7.5 .
studies on cytochrome oxidase .
partial resolution of enzymes containing seven or six subunits , from yeast and beef heart , respectively .
highly active , essentially homogeneous , preparations of <unk> c oxidase ( ec <unk> ) have been obtained from both yeast and beef heart by extraction with <unk> , fractionation with ammonium sulfate , and replacement of <unk> by tween 20 .
the molecular weights of the resultant proteins equal 260 <unk> 23 x 10 ( 3 ) and 205 <unk> 10 ( 3 ) ; they contain seven and six different polypeptide subunits , respectively , all in <unk> amounts , with apparent molecular weights of 42.4 , 34.1 , 24.7 , 14.6 , 14.6 , 12.3 , 10.6 x 10 ( 3 ) , and 47.5 , 20.4 , 14.5 , 14.5 , 13.0 , 11.0 x 10 ( 3 ) , respectively .
by means of <unk> chromatography on <unk> coupled to agarose these enzymes can be stripped of their largest subunit ( s ) resulting in preparations with molecular weights of 170 <unk> 17 x 10 ( 3 ) and 124 <unk> 20 x 10 ( 3 ) , and containing only five polypeptides , with the largest remaining one ( molecular weight congruent to 20 x 10 ( 3 ) ) present in less than stoichiometric amounts .
this interconversion and subunit removal has been monitored by exclusion chromatography , four systems of acrylamide gel electrophoresis -- some with the protein labeled with <unk> under denaturing conditions -- isoelectric focusing , and hydrodynamic methods .
it has virtually no effect on heme a and copper content and on the catalytic parameters of the enzymes .
we conclude that subunits i and ii in enzymes from fungal , and subunit i in those from animal , sources are dispensable for the catalysis of the oxidation of <unk> c by , and are probably not essential for the <unk> of prosthetic groups to , these proteins .
isolation and characterization of crystalline methylglyoxal synthetase from proteus vulgaris .
methylglyoxal synthetase , which catalyzes the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to methylglyoxal and inorganic phosphate , has been isolated and crystalized in good yields from proteus vulgaris .
the enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by a variety of criteria and was found to be a dimer ( mr = 135,000 ; s20 , w = 7.2 s ) composed of two apparently identical catalytic and physical properties and their <unk> nature suggest that they do not represent true isozymes .
the enzyme is specific for dihydroxyacetone phosphate and does not form methylglyoxal from glyceraldehyde <unk> , glyceraldehyde , or dihydroxyacetone .
<unk> analogs are neither substrates nor <unk> inhibitors , but a variety of phosphorylated analogs are competitive with respect to dihydroxyacetone phosphate .
the enzyme is inhibited by inorganic orthophosphate in a complex manner which is overcome by dihydroxyacetone phosphate in a <unk> manner
beef kidney <unk> acid oxygenase .
purification , characterization , and analysis of the assay .
beef kidney <unk> acid oxygenase has been purified to homogeneity .
it is a single subunit protein of mr = 34,000 <unk> 2,000 with a frictional coefficient ( <unk> ) of about 1.1 .
the enzyme readily aggregates to form , apparently inactive , higher molecular weight oligomers .
the very rapid loss of enzyme activity during the assay was analyzed extensively .
it was found to be due to inactivation of the enzyme by the substrate , <unk> , and unrelated to enzyme turnover or oxidation of bound iron .
the loss of activity was shown to be a first order decay process , and methods are given for obtaining accurate initial reaction rates under all conditions .
evidence was presented that the enzyme assumes a catalytically inactive conformation at ph 3.4 , which only relatively slowly rearranges to an active form at ph 6.5 ; the rearrangement can be blocked by the presence of substrate .
we have found that <unk> , which is required for enzymatic activity , can equilibrate freely , albeit slowly , with the enzyme during the course of the enzyme reaction even in the presence of saturating <unk> .
under assay conditons , the <unk> has an apparent dissociation constant of 0.04 mm .
the kinetic properties of the enzyme were found to be dramatically different in beta , <unk> buffer and <unk> buffer ; both the rate of loss of activity during the assay and the substrate km and vmax were affected .
effects of <unk> and <unk> on the catalytic and physical properties of pancreatic lipase b at an oil water interface .
a monolayer reaction system employing <unk> and <unk> glass beads was used to study the effects of <unk> and <unk> on the catalytic activity , interfacial stability , and interfacial affinity of porcine pancreatic lipase b ( ec <unk> ) the stability and catalytic activity of lipase at the <unk> interface are governed by the same two <unk> groups with pka values ( in the absence of cofactors ) of 5.6 and 9.3 .
<unk> alone or with bile salt caused only a slight perturbation of these values .
at low concentrations , 0 to <unk> , <unk> increases the stability of lipase by 5-fold .
at higher concentrations , 0.3 to 0.8 mm , but still below its critical micelle concentration , <unk> prevents the adsorption of lipase to the <unk> interface .
this appears to be the major mechanism by which this bile salt inhibits lipolysis .
<unk> exerts small positive effects on lipase stability and catalytic activity .
more importantly , <unk> enables the adsorption of lipase in the presence of bile salt , thereby reversing the inhibition .
rickettsial permeability .
an <unk> transport system .
the obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium , rickettsia <unk> , has a <unk> transport system for adp and atp .
the transport of nucleotides was measured by membrane filtration assays ; the assay was shown not to harm the relatively labile <unk> .
the nucleotide transport system was shown to reside in the <unk> , not in the contaminating yolk sac mitochondria of the preparation .
the influx of nucleotide had an activation energy of 12 to 13 kcal above 22 <unk> ( an apparent transition temperature ) , and 30 kcal below this value .
the uptake of nucleotide was independent of the <unk> concentration , but was markedly stimulated by the phosphate concentration .
the ph optimum of the influx of nucleotide was ph 7 .
the specificity of the transport system was remarkable in that it required a specific moiety in each portion of the nucleotide , i.e. an adenine base , a ribose sugar , and two or three , but not one , phosphates .
of the wide variety of compounds tested , the system could transport only adp , atp , and ( beta , <unk> ) adenosine <unk> .
the influx of nucleotide was a saturable process ; <unk> velocity was achieved at a nucleotide concentration of about 75 mum .
adp and atp were competitive inhibitors of each <unk> transport .
although at least 95 % of the labeled intracellular nucleotide was exchangeable , efflux of labeled nucleotide was observed only in the presence of unlabeled nucleotide in the medium .
<unk> efflux was achieved at a concentration of about 75 mum .
a large intracellular to extracellular concentration gradient of labeled nucleotide was maintained in the presence of metabolic inhibitors and <unk> , which completely abolished rickettsial hemolysis .
while having no effect on the steady state , kcn and dnp accelerated both influx and efflux .
measurements of the endogenous pool of adenine nucleotides in isolated <unk> show that is was large ( 5 mm ) , and that these unlabeled nucleotides exchanged , on approximately a 1/1 basis , with exogenously added nucleotide .
these studies support the proposal that <unk> are not `` leaky '' to adenine nucleotides or to small molecules in general , and that they have a <unk> transport system which allows an exchange of host and parasite adp and atp .
monomeric purine nucleoside phosphorylase from rabbit liver .
purification and characterization .
rabbit liver purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( purine nucleoside : orthophosphate <unk> ec <unk> ) was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography and ammonium sulfate fractionation .
homogeneity was established by disc gel electrophoresis in presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate , and isoelectric focusing .
molecular weights of 46,000 and 39,000 were determined , respectively , by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl <unk> disc gel electrophoresis .
product inhibition was observed with guanine and hypoxanthine as strong competitive inhibitors for the enzymatic <unk> of guanosine .
respective kis calculated were 1.25 x 10 ( -5 ) m for guanine and 2.5 x 10 ( -5 ) m for hypoxanthine .
ribose 1-phosphate , another product of the reaction , gave noncompetitive inhibition with guanosine as variable substrate , and an inhibition constant of 3.61 x 10 ( -4 ) m was calculated .
the protection of essential -- sh groups on the enzyme , by <unk> or <unk> , was necessary for the maintenance of enzyme activity .
noncompetitive inhibition was observed for <unk> with an inhibition constant of 5.68 x 10 ( -6 ) m .
complete reversal of this inhibition by an excess of <unk> or <unk> was demonstrated .
in the presence of methylene blue , the enzyme showed a high sensitivity to <unk> and a dependence of <unk> on ph , strongly implicating histidine as the susceptible group at the active site of the enzyme .
the pka values determined for <unk> groups of the active site of the enzyme were near ph 5.5 and ph 8.5 the chemical and kinetic evidences suggest that histidine and cysteine may be essential for catalysis .
inorganic orthophosphate ( km 1.54 x 10 ( -2 ) m ) was an obligatory anion requirement , and arsenate substituted for phosphate with comparable results .
guanosine ( km 5.00 x 10 ( -5 ) m ) , <unk> ( km 1.00 x 10 ( -4 ) m ) and inosine ( km 1.33 x 10 ( -4 ) m ) , were substrates for enzymatic <unk> .
<unk> was an extremely poor substrate , and adenosine was not <unk> at 20-fold excess of the homogeneous enzyme .
guanine ( km 1.82 x 10 ( -5 ) m ) , ribose 1-phosphate ( km 1.34 x 10 ( -4 ) m ) and hypoxanthine were substrates for the reverse reaction , namely , the enzymatic synthesis of nucleosides .
the initial velocity studies of the saturation of the enzyme with guanosine , at various fixed concentrations of inorganic orthophosphate , suggest a sequential <unk> catalytic mechanism for the enzyme .
purification to homogeneity and properties of two d-alanine <unk> i from escherichia coli .
three homogeneous preparations of d-alanine <unk> i have been obtained from escherichia coli strain <unk> , termed enzymes ia , ib , and ic .
enzyme ia purified from the membrane after extraction with triton <unk> appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to be a polypeptide doublet whose monomer molecular weights were about 32,000 and 34,000 .
in addition to d-alanine carboxypeptidase activity , it catalyzed a <unk> reaction with several substrates , bound [ 14c ] penicillin g , had a weak <unk> activity , but was devoid of endopeptidase activity .
enzyme ib obtained from the membrane after <unk> extraction and enzyme ic obtained from the supernatant solution were either identical or extremely similar .
they were composed of a single polypeptide whose monomer molecular weight was about 41,000 .
in addition to carboxypeptidase activity , they catalyzed an endopeptidase reaction , had weak <unk> activity , and had very poor <unk> activity , but did not bind [ 14c ] penicillin g .
some data relating to the mechanism of catalysis by these enzymes are described .
their possible physiological role is discussed .
effects of <unk> binding on the visible absorption spectrum of methemoglobin .
the binding of <unk> to human methemoglobin causes a perturbation of the visible heme <unk> spectrum which is expressed by an increase in absorbance in the high spin band regions , 480 to 510 nm and 590 to 640 nm , concomitant with a decrease in absorbance in the <unk> and <unk> absorption regions .
the ph dependence of the <unk> difference spectrum can be accounted for quantitatively by a 5 % shift toward higher spin of the <unk> form of methemoglobin , a 15 % shift toward higher spin of the hydroxide form , and a shift in the apparent pka for the water to hydroxide transition from 7.92 to 8.04 when mercurial is bound .
the rate of these heme <unk> changes is consistent with the rapid second order formation of the <unk> cysteine , <unk> bond and does not represent a change due to the dissociation of methemoglobin tetramers into dimers , even though the latter , slow process does follow mercurial binding .
the observation of an increase in spin produced by the binding of a reagent which also promotes dimer formation argues strongly against any direct correlation between an increase in spin and the appearance of <unk> conformations .
binding of inositol <unk> to human methemoglobin .
the observed static difference spectrum produced by inositol <unk> binding to methemoglobin is the sum of a very fast and a slow spectral transition .
the more rapid absorbance change is too fast to be measured by stopped flow techniques , whereas the slow change exhibits a half-time in the range 1 to 6 s .
from the ph dependence of the rapidly formed difference spectrum and from a series of heme ligand binding studies , the rapid phase is interpreted to reflect a localized tertiary conformational change which immediately accompanies inositol <unk> binding and results in a selective increase in spin and reactivity of the beta chain heme groups .
in contrast , the slow phase appears to reflect a first order isomerization process which involves only a small portion ( less than 10 % ) of the hemoglobin molecules and results primarily in a marked alteration of the spectral properties of the alpha chains with little change in spin .
while the rapid spectral transition can not be directly related to the overall quaternary transition which occurs during oxygen binding to ferrous <unk> , the slow spectral transition may represent the abortive formation of a <unk> a-like conformation which is inhibited in both rate and extent by the presence of water molecules bound to the heme iron atoms .
molecular size of nerve growth factor in dilute solution .
nerve growth factor ( ngf ) is a protein composed of two identical chains of mass <unk> .
an analysis of the sedimentation equilibrium , sedimentation velocity , and gel filtration behavior of dilute solutions of ngf indicates the existence of a rapidly reversible monomer in equilibrium dimer equilibrium and that the association constant k for the reaction at neutral ph is 9.4 x 10 ( 6 ) m-1 .
reaction mixtures consist of equal concentrations of monomer and dimer at a total protein concentration as high as 1.4 <unk> , and at 1 ng/ml , monomer accounts for greater than 99 % of the total .
the latter concentration is 20 to 30 times that required for the biological activity of ngf .
several lines of evidence suggest that the dimerization reaction is highly stereospecific , although its biological significance is not known .
carbon 13 resonances of <unk> <unk> adducts of alpha and beta chains in human adult hemoglobin .
the principal component of normal adult human hemoglobin ao , was equilibrated under various conditions with <unk> .
in addition , derivatives containing specifically <unk> <unk> groups in alpha or beta chains , or both , were prepared by treatment with cyanate , and equilibrated likewise to allow the identification of specific resonances observed by 13c nuclear magnetic resonance .
in <unk> , a <unk> at 29.2 ppm upfield of external cs2 was assigned to the alpha chain terminal adduct , and one at 29.8 ppm to the beta chain terminal adduct .
in the <unk> state as the co derivative , the terminal adduct on both chains showed a common resonance position at 29.8 ppm .
small effects of ph on the resonance positions were observed .
under certain conditions , a resonance was observed at 33.4 ppm , probably not <unk> to a <unk> compound .
a <unk> resonance that became prominent at higher ph was found at 28.4 ppm , and is tentatively ascribed to one or more adducts on epsilon amino groups .
the beta chain resonances in particular are minimized by the presence of inositol <unk> or <unk> .
quantitative analysis of the resonance intensities shows that the effects of conversion from the <unk> to the <unk> state in reducing the degree of <unk> adduct is much more pronounced for the beta than for the alpha chains .
purine nucleotide cycle .
evidence for the occurrence of the cycle in brain .
cell-free extracts of rat brain catalyze the reactions of the purine nucleotide cycle .
ammonia is formed during the deamination but not the amination phase of the cycle .
the activity of adenylate deaminase in brain is sufficient to account for the maximum rates of ammonia production that have been reported .
the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase is not sufficient to account for these rates of ammonia production .
the activities of <unk> synthetase and <unk> are nearly sufficient to account for the steady state rates of ammonia production observed in brain .
demonstration of the cycle in extracts of brain is complicated by the occurrence of side reactions , in particular those catalyzed by <unk> , nucleoside phosphorylase , and <unk> .
kinetics of <unk> dimerization .
a method has been devised which permits the observation of the loss of active sites promoted by aggregation of <unk> .
when <unk> in <unk> solution at ph 7 is mixed with buffered <unk> by stopped flow instrumentation to give a final ph of 3.89 , a decrease in active sites occurs , as measured by a decrease in <unk> complex .
the decrease in the rate of active sites shows a linear dependence on the square of the concentration of active sites remaining at equilibrium .
the kinetic data of the reaction have been correlated with equilibrium measurements .
rate constants for formation and dissociation of dimer are 9.45 x 10 ( 3 ) m ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) and 1.9 s ( -1 ) , , respectively .
calculation of <unk> for dimer from rate constants gives a value of 2.01 x 10 ( -4 ) m , while direct determination of <unk> gives a value of 1.44 x 10 ( -4 ) m .
effect of lumbar sympathetic blockade and <unk> adrenergic <unk> blockade on skin temperature in peripheral arterial diseases .
the <unk> toe temperature changes after lumbar sympathetic blockade and after intramuscular administration of an adrenergic <unk> blocking substance ( chlorpromazine ) were studied in 14 patients with impending gangrene because of peripheral arterial insufficiency .
the <unk> temperature rise was similar after sympathetic blockage and chlorpromazine administration and significantly different from the basal toe temperature changes after cooling .
it is concluded that administration of an adrenergic <unk> blocking substance is as good as the lumbar sympathetic blockage for evaluation of a remaining sympathetic vasomotor tone in arterial disease patients .
serum stimulation of phosphate uptake into <unk> cells .
the stimulation by calf serum of phosphate uptake into <unk> cells results from a change in maximum velocity of the transport process with no change in the michaelis constant .
only arsenate among a series of inorganic structural analogs of phosphate inhibited phosphate uptake indicating a high specificity for the process .
the arsenate inhibition was competitive in nature .
papaverine , theophylline , and <unk> e1 , drugs known to maintain high intracellular levels of camp , had little effect on serum stimulated phosphate uptake .
the phosphate uptake stimulating factor ( s ) in serum could be <unk> from the <unk> cell survival and migration factors by stability characteristics , but this factor ( s ) could not be completely separated from a uridine uptake stimulation activity or growth promoting activity using a variety of serum fractionation procedures .
only partial stimulation of the uptake process was achieved with any one serum fraction indicating a multiplicity of serum components is probably involved in this process .
because of the rapidity of serum activation of phosphate uptake and its apparent independence of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels , it is suggested that serum factors may stimulate phosphate uptake by inducing structural changes in the phosphate carrier system .
dinoflagellate bioluminescence : a comparative study of invitro components .
in vitro bioluminescence components of the dinoflagellates <unk> <unk> , g. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> were studied .
the <unk> and <unk> of the four species <unk> in all combinations .
all of these species possess <unk> weight <unk> ( <unk> daltons ) with similar ph activity profiles .
the active single chains of <unk> from the <unk> species have a mw of 130,000 while those from p. <unk> and d. lunula have a mw of 60,000 .
extractable luciferase activity varies with time of day in the two <unk> species , but not in the other two .
a luciferin binding protein ( lbp ) can easily be extracted from the two <unk> species ( mw approximately 120,000 daltons ) , but none could be detected in extracts of either d. lunula or p. <unk> .
<unk> are extractable from all four species , but they vary in density and the degree to which activity can be increased by added luciferin .
although the biochemistry of bioluminescence in these dinoflagellates is generally similar , the observations that d. lunula and p. <unk> apparently lack lbp and have <unk> with low mw single chains require further clarification .
control of phenylalanine hydroxylase synthesis in tissue culture by serum and insulin .
<unk> , minimal deviation <unk> <unk> cell cultures that are <unk> respond with a biphasic time course of phenylalanine hydroxylase induction when <unk> fetal calf serum or insulin is added .
these two agents induce phenylalanine hydroxylase additively , during both the initial 3-hour and the delayed 24-hour phases .
the initial phase of induction by insulin is inhibited by <unk> but not by <unk> d .
the delayed induction by both <unk> fetal calf serum and insulin is inhibited by 10 ( -6 ) m <unk> and 0.20 <unk> <unk> d .
<unk> cells in culture do not synthesize the factor ( s ) in serum that induce phenylalanine hydroxylase .
reaction of acidified nitrite solutions with peptide derivatives : evidence for <unk> and <unk> formation from 15n <unk> studies .
backbone rearrangements of steroidal <unk> .
reactions of cytosine and cytidine with <unk> <unk> .
high-speed <unk> partition chromatography in pharmaceutical analysis .
<unk> chromatography offers attractive possibilities in pharmaceutical analysis .
the specificity of the separation systems can be varied over a wide range by appropriate selection of the stationary phase .
the choice of a suitable <unk> can also drastically improve the detection limit , permitting the determination of drug substances in low dosage and possibly of by-products or breakdown products .
<unk> chromatography of tropane and ergot alkaloids has been investigated using <unk> as <unk> .
alumina , <unk> and various grades of silica gel have been tested as supports .
partition properties studied in a batch procedure have been compared with the actual chromatographic conditions .
columns ( 10 cm ) filled with <unk> gel ( particle size , 5 mum ; pore size , 1000 a ) show the best performance in the separation of hyoscyamine , scopolamine and ergotamine as <unk> <unk> .
close control of ph and temperature is essential for reproducible separations .
improvements in detection limits between 100 and 300 times have been observed with these systems .
<unk> extractions of these alkaloids from dosage forms can be used for sample preparation prior to injection on the the column .
this provides an added degree of selectivity and sensitivity .
analytical separation of amino acids on a <unk> resin cross-linked with <unk> .
the elution bands of acidic and neutral amino acids of protein <unk> , emerging from the column of a <unk> resin cross-linked with pure <unk> , are narrower than those from a resin prepared from styrene and technical <unk> .
as a result of these narrower bands , a more complete resolution of the critical pairs <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is obtained .
the most probable reason for the narrower elution peaks is the more rapid diffusion of the exchanged components through the bulk of the resin as a result of a more regular arrangement of <unk> in the <unk> resin prepared from <unk> .
[ template chromatography on immobilized <unk> synthesis and application of <unk> -- <unk> ( <unk> transl ) ] .
oligomers of <unk> acid , obtained by <unk> , were covalently attached to polyvinyl alcohol .
these <unk> oligonucleotides undergo very strong adsorption on <unk> such that at neutral ph and with 1 m nacl , partial <unk> occurs only above 60 degrees .
the use of this pv ( pa ) <unk> for the column chromatographic separation of <unk> acid oligomers obtained by <unk> , according to the principle of base-pairing , is discussed .
linear oligomers and also pyrophosphate derivatives of <unk> acid which contain more than five monomer units undergo strong retardation under the conditions of base-pairing .
cyclic oligonucleotides do not show any noticeable interaction with the stationary phase .
thus , through the use of a temperature gradient , it is possible to fractionally separate the <unk> , giving an average degree of polymerisation of 6 -- 10 .
a rapid and comprehensive system for the routine identification of drugs in biological material based on <unk> extraction and drug colour profiles .
the separation of basic , acidic and neutral drugs from <unk> extracts of serum , urine and tissue <unk> at different ph values using a <unk> extraction technique is described .
following preliminary screening , the various <unk> fractions obtained are further examined by two-dimensional <unk> chromatography .
the drugs present are identified with reference to documented standards with the aid of a drug colour profile system and rf values relative to three different reference standards .
by means of gas chromatographic analysis of the same extracts , <unk> estimates of the amounts of drugs present , which are sufficiently accurate for clinical emergency purposes , can be made in many instances .
the main advantages of the system are `` clean '' extracts with a minimum of background interference , rapidity ( 4-6 h for a complete analysis ) and systematically documented and visually presented behaviour of drugs after spraying with various chromogenic and <unk> reagents , allowing the systematic identification of unknown substances .
ion-exchange chromatography of the more basic amino acids of protein <unk> using stepwise changes of buffers containing borate ions .
chromatographic behaviour of alkaloids on thin layers of anion and cation <unk> .
i. ag <unk> and <unk> d .
the chromatographic behaviour of 48 alkaloids has been studied on <unk> ag <unk> , <unk> d and microcrystalline cellulose , eluting with solutions of different ph but constant ionic strength ( 0.5 ) .
many interesting separations were effected on both ag <unk> and <unk> d layers .
the influence of ph on the chromatographic behaviour of alkaloids has been quantitatively studied and an equation was used that expresses the behaviour of the alkaloids on both ag <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> cellulose layers .
the <unk> of this equation to <unk> d layers is discussed .
determination of trimethylsilyl methylated nucleic acid bases in urine by <unk> chromatography .
a method for the determination of the urinary excretion level of methylated nucleic acid bases by <unk> chromatography ( glc ) has been developed .
a clean-up procedure prior to glc analysis consisted of hydrolysis , filtration , charcoal adsorption , and anion exchange .
studies to determine optimum <unk> conditions for conversion of the methylated bases to their trimethylsilyl derivatives and to evaluate glc parameters and columns to obtain the best separation were conducted .
application of the method was shown by determining the excretion levels of methylated bases in urine of normal controls and of patients with various types of malignancy .
high-resolution liquid chromatographic analysis of methylated purine and pyrimidine bases in transfer rna .
methylated and major purine and pyrimidine bases were separated and quantified by high-resolution liquid chromatography after hydrolyzing transfer ribonucleic acids ( trnas ) .
separation was accomplished by eluting the hydrolyzed samples from an <unk> column with a concentration gradient of ammonium acetate at ph 9.2 .
isolated sample of trna were hydrolyzed to the free bases with a trifluoroacetic <unk> acid mixture of 200 degrees .
detection limits of 100-200 ng/ml were measured for the methylated bases ; analytical data are reported for ten methylated bases plus the four major bases of calf liver and rat liver trna .
gas chromatographic separation of <unk> and <unk> .
a new gas chromatographic method for the estimation of reserpine and <unk> .
under the conditions described for alkaline hydrolysis of reserpine and <unk> in absolute and aqueous methanol , and after esterification ( with diazomethane ) of the resulting acid fraction , methyl <unk> was quantitatively recovered , whereas methyl <unk> , in normal lighting conditions , was either partly <unk> to methyl <unk> or formed an adduct with a molecule of methanol , yielding methyl <unk> ( <unk> ) propionate .
the structures of the products were established by synthesis , nuclear magnetic resonance studies and mass spectrometry .
this investigation of the hydrolytic conditions allowed a reliable and rapid gas chromatographic determination of reserpine and/or <unk> in amounts down to 500 and 2000 mug , respectively , to be devised .
specific ion-exchange chromatography and <unk> assay for urinary <unk> .
a technique for the selective extraction of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from a single urine sample has been investigated .
after hydrolysis of the conjugates , the diluted mixture is passed through a <unk> <unk> column and the <unk> amines are eluted by means of concentrated ammonia .
the <unk> , containing <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is evaporated , and a solution of the residue in borate buffer is fractionated under strictly controlled conditions on an <unk> <unk> column .
the three amines so separated are estimated by specific <unk> methods .
the extraction recovery is 80 <unk> 3 % for pure solutions and 78 <unk> 4 % for <unk> added to urine .
the <unk> procedure , carried out under well-defined conditions , allows the estimation of 10 ng of <unk> .
the spectral characteristics of the fluorescent derivative are similar to those obtained with dopamine , so that it can be assumed that iodine oxidation of <unk> <unk> this compound and <unk> the resulting dopamine to the dopamine fluorophore ( <unk> ) .
of the compounds that might interfere in the <unk> procedure , dopamine , dopa and <unk> are destroyed by the <unk> elution from the <unk> column and <unk> is eliminated in the effluent from the <unk> column .
the elimination of interfering compounds and the improved separation on <unk> ensure high specificity for this procedure .
we have applied the method to normal urine and to pathological <unk> from patients with adrenergic tumours or untreated and treated parkinsonian subjects ; vital information has been obtained on the prognosis of adrenergic tumours .
the presence of large amounts of dopamine , <unk> and/or <unk> does not affect the assay for <unk> .
the method is also applicable to rat and dog urine , and can be applied to tissue extracts with little modification .
analysis of the <unk> for gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) : studies on the effect of <unk> gnrh .
when gnrh is <unk> by the <unk> method , two <unk> labeled species are formed at ph 6.5 with a <unk> : gnrh molar ratio of 11:1 , whereas four bands ( i , iia , iib , and iii ) are separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when the hormone is iodinated at ph 7.5 in a system containing a <unk> molar ratio of <unk> : gnrh .
because they were more stable and were more <unk> than the other products , band i and band iia from the latter system were used separately as tracers with <unk> antiserum <unk> in <unk> for gnrh .
the standard curves of each tracer are distinct : when analyzed after <unk> transformation , the band i curve had a mean slope of <unk> <unk> 0.2 ( se ) and a 50 % <unk> level of 9 <unk> 0.8 pg ( <unk> ) of synthetic gnrh , whereas the band iia standard curve had a slope of <unk> <unk> 0.6 and a 50 % <unk> value of 20 <unk> 0.9 pg ( <unk> ) .
the sensitivity of both assays is approximately 2.0 pg .
gn rh concentrations in plasma and serum samples assayed with band i were consistently greater than those assayed with band iia .
normal adult male plasmas assayed with band i measured 21 <unk> 0.9 pg/ml , whereas band iia values were 8 <unk> 0.4 pg/ml .
no difference between plasma and serum was detected , nor was there any difference among adult men , adult women , <unk> children , <unk> patients , or <unk> patients with either assay .
plasma gnrh concentrations were also similar in jugular and vena cava samples from intact and castrated male rats .
because many of the samples were at or below the sensitivity of the band iia assay , they were concentrated after extraction with either methanol or <unk> .
however , endogenous <unk> gnrh could not be concentrated by these extraction procedures .
as measured in the band iia assay , hypothalamic extracts from control adult male rats contained 3.1 <unk> 0.4 ng while <unk> from castrated rats contained 1.4 <unk> 0.1 ng .
similar but slightly lower values were obtained with band i .
in contrast , the gnrh content of pineal glands from intact and castrated male rats was similar ( approximately 150 pg ) when determined in either assay .
these studies emphasize that : 1 ) the characteristics of the <unk> hormone can influence the quantitation of gnrh ; and 2 ) endogenous plasma concentrations of gnrh are much lower than previously reported .
<unk> of pneumococcal antigens : improved sensitivity for the detection of types vii and xiv .
rapid identification of streptococcus pneumoniae has been reported using <unk> for the detection of specific capsular antigens in serum , cerebrospinal fluid , and urine .
previous clinical studies have failed to detect type vii or xiv pneumococcal antigen .
these two types , however , account for a significant portion of pneumococcal disease .
the incorporation of a <unk> derivative of <unk> acid in the buffer system provides a method for the sensitive detection of these types in artificial mixtures without greatly reducing the sensitivity for the detection of other pneumococcal types .
a problem with false positives encountered using human serum and <unk> was reduced by the use of buffer containing <unk> <unk> acid .
isolation of streptococcal nuclease b by batch adsorption .
a method has been developed for the preparation of streptococcal nuclease b by batch <unk> to <unk> .
the enzyme is homogeneous with respect to nuclease activity and is suitable for use as an antigen in measurement of <unk> b levels in sera .
rapid screening of <unk> by ultraviolet fluorescence .
among 51 strains of anaerobic gram-negative cocci belonging to the family <unk> , all strains of <unk> ( v. parvula and v. <unk> ) displayed red fluorescence under long-wave ( 366 nm ) ultraviolet light , whereas no <unk> or <unk> demonstrated fluorescence .
in contrast to bacteroides <unk> , growth of <unk> does not require hemin and <unk> , and <unk> is rapidly lost upon exposure to air .
the fluorescent component of a strain of v. parvula examined could not be extracted in solution with water , ether , methanol , or chloroform , but was readily extracted with 0.4 n naoh .
<unk> , the fluorescence maximum of this extract was 660 nm with an excitation maximum of 300 nm , when measured at ph 7.2 and 25 c .
coupled with the gram stain , ultraviolet fluorescence may be a useful tool for rapid screening of <unk> and is particularly helpful for detection and , isolation of this organism from mixed culture .
retention of mercurial preservatives in desiccated biological products .
a variety of <unk> , vaccines , and <unk> retained greater than 90 % of their original level of mercurial preservative after <unk> , and this might influence certain uses of these products .
distribution and removal of added mercury in milk .
distribution patterns of added mercury in raw whole milk after equilibration for 30 min and 2 h at 37 c showed a distribution among acid casein , whey proteins , fat globule membrane , and soluble fat globule membrane of 33 , 28 , 16 , and 2 % .
on the basis of protein content , the fat globule membrane had the highest amount of mercury .
mercury added to milk as mercuric chloride was removed by treatment with <unk> <unk> <unk> and reduced human hair .
in a 5 min treatment , 70 , 43 , and 41 % of the mercury was removed by <unk> <unk> cellulose , <unk> <unk> cellulose , and reduced human hair , respectively , from whole milk initially containing 1 ppm mercury and equilibrated for 2 h at 37 c prior to treatment .
after treatment for 60 min , 82 , 52 , and 64 % of the mercury was removed by <unk> <unk> cellulose , <unk> <unk> cellulose , and reduced hair , respectively .
however , increasing incubation temperature and time prior to treatment decreased the removal efficiencies .
<unk> <unk> cellulose and reduced human hair showed increasing efficiency directly with ph , while <unk> <unk> cellulose showed the opposite effect and had higher affinity for mercury at ph 5.5 than at ph 7.5 .
moreover , the rate of removal of mercury at 4 c compared to 37 c was much slower .
the removal of mercury from soluble casein and soluble whey proteins was more efficient than from micellar casein .
protein , lactose content , and ph of milk were not changed by the polymer treatments .

demonstration of a <unk> inhibitory nervous system in the trachea of the guinea pig .
a <unk> inhibitory nervous system has been demonstrated in the guinea pig trachea .
electrical field stimulation of this system , in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade , resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine .
the relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin , which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation .
the gastrointestinal tract , which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract , also has a <unk> inhibitory system .
in the gastrointestinal tract , this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis , and absence of this system , in the colon and the rectum , is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in <unk> disease .
it is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory <unk> inhibitory system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the <unk> airways in asthma .
the airways , due to a lack of inhibition , may be either partially contracted or unable to relax , and thus appear <unk> to stimuli .

non-specific alkaline <unk> of eight species of <unk> trematodes .
alkaline phosphatases from different trematodes occupying the same habitat have identical ph <unk> but different levels of enzyme activities .
<unk> <unk> , from the fish <unk> attu , shows four to six times more enzyme activity than <unk> <unk> , <unk> hominis and <unk> <unk> , from the pig sus scrofa , and fasciola <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , from the buffalo bubalus <unk> .
at least two peaks of activity at different levels of ph were obtained for each trematode examined .
both <unk> hominis and <unk> <unk> enzymes had three peaks of alkaline phosphatase activity .
the optimum temperature for maximum enzyme activity was 40 degrees c , above which rapid inactivation occurred .
at temperatures below 40 degrees c , the enzymes of fish and mammalian trematodes did not behave similarly ; i. <unk> enzyme being active over a wider range of temperature ( 20 <unk> degrees c .
various concentrations of kcn and arsenate proportionately inhibited enzyme activity .
naf did not significantly influence enzyme activity , while <unk> and <unk> acted as activators .
the extent of inhibition or activation of enzyme activity of different trematodes varied , probably due to species differences .
both inhibition and activation of i. <unk> enzyme was higher than in the case of other trematodes .
fractionation of mycobacterial antigens by vertical electrophoresis in the polyacrylamide gel .
the effect of neonatal rat <unk> disease ( gvhd ) on fc receptor lymphocytes .
the level of fc receptor <unk> lymphocytes ( <unk> ) was examined in spleen and lymph node cell suspension from neonatal da and bn rats inoculated within 24 hr of birth with either allogeneic l ( experimental ) or <unk> ( control ) lymphoid cells .
in addition , these levels were compared to fetal and neonatal animals that received no injection .
the indicator cells ( ea ) were sheep erythrocytes sensitized with one-half concentration of the highest dilution of rabbit <unk> erythrocyte igg ( a ) which <unk> an equal amount of 1 % suspension of e .
care was taken to exclude scoring macrophages by injecting colloidal carbon at least 1 hr before killing the test animals .
the spleen of 19-day da fetal rats exhibited a level of 19.3 % <unk> , similar to that of animals having received adult <unk> cells at birth ( 40.0 % ) by day 7 .
thereafter the level of <unk> did not vary appreciably between these two groups .
however , as early as 2 days after inoculation there was a significantly greater number of <unk> in the spleen of experimental da neonates compared to controls .
the lymph nodes of experimental animals did not exhibit a significantly greater number of <unk> until day 6 with both tissue compartments peaking at day 10 and remaining significantly higher than controls until death .
in neonatal bn animals significantly higher levels of <unk> in experimental animals were not evident as early and peaked later ( day 12 ) in both tissue compartments but again these differences remained until death .
cytotoxic <unk> demonstrated that on days 6 , 10 , and 12 most , if not all , of the <unk> were host in <unk> in both da and bn gvhd , with a very significant host plasma cell response in such gvhd animals .
<unk> tissue section revealed the presence of a great number of plasma cell especially prominent in the medulla of lymph nodes with the cortex of lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen markedly depleted of lymphocytes indicative of cytotoxicity .
kinetics of the antibody response to type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide ( <unk> ) .
i. use of <unk> <unk> to study serum antibody levels , as well as the distribution and excretion of antigen after immunization .
a simple method was described for the preparation of <unk> type iii <unk> polysaccharide ( <unk> ) with a high specific radioactivity which retained the physical and immunologic properties of native <unk> .
<unk> was used to study the serum and tissue levels of antigen , as well as its excretion , after i.p. injection .
when an optimally immunogenic dose ( 0.5 mug ) of antigen was given , greater than 90 % of the injected antigen was excreted during the first 3 days after injection ; however , after day 3 , the <unk> which remained in each mouse was firmly bound to various tissues , and less than 5 ng <unk> was released into the circulation daily .
<unk> was also used in a farr test to measure serum antibody levels ; the kinetics for the appearance of <unk> and serum antibody levels were measured at 24-hr intervals after immunization with 0.5 mug of antigen .
maximum <unk> were observed on day 4 after immunization whereas the peak serum antibody level was seen on day 5 .
the decay of serum antibody level from its maximum value was much slower than that of the <unk> .
the data describing the distribution of <unk> in vivo and the measurement of serum antibody levels indicated that treadmill neutralization was not a factor in determining the serum antibody levels after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of <unk> .
kinetics of the antibody response to type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide .
ii .
factors influencing the serum antibody levels after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of antigen .
when the number of pfc present in the spleen was measured at 24-hr intervals after immunizing with an optimally immunogenic dose of type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide ( <unk> ) , maximal numbers of pfc were attained 4 days after immunization ; thereafter , the number of pfc decreased rapidly .
by contrast , serum antibody levels , which were measured in the same mice using a farr test , reached peak values 5 days after immunization and then declined much more slowly than did the number of pfc .
two factors were found to contribute to this disparity .
first , experiments conducted with <unk> mice showed that <unk> antibody synthesis , which began between days 3 and 4 after immunization and peaked on days 6 to 7 , accounted for nearly one-third of the total amount of serum antibody produced .
second , the average rate of antibody synthesis by pfc increased through day 6 after immunization and then declined .
<unk> dissociation tests showed that the avidity of the serum antibody obtained 4 to 7 days after immunization was the same .
moreover , during the same interval , all the antibody detected by the farr test was of the igm class .
thus , a change in avidity or class of immunoglobulin after day 5 did not account for the disparity observed .
the clearance rate of antibody injected i.v. into <unk> and immunized mice was studied .
the data obtained indicated that accelerated clearance of antibody was occurring prior to day 3 after immunization ; however , after day 3 the antibody clearance rate was constant and was the same as that found when antibody was injected into <unk> mice .
these findings affirmed the results of previous studies showing that treadmill neutralization was not important in determining the serum antibody levels present after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of <unk> .
mouse epidermal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase .
mouse skin contains a <unk> , aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase ( ahh ) , which is inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
in general , unsubstituted polycyclic hydrocarbons caused a greater induction of epidermal ahh than substituted one ( <unk> greater than <unk> greater than benz ( a ) anthracene equal <unk> greater than <unk> ( a ) anthracene ) which did not correlate with their ability to initiate tumors in mouse skin .
two different techniques were used to isolate epidermis and similar results were obtained with both .
however , the technique of isolating epidermis using a mild heat treatment required that the temperature be maintained at 52 degrees c for 30 sec .
if the temperature was raised to 54 degrees c or above , there was a large reduction in the ahh activity .
isolated epidermis has 4 to 5 times the ahh activity as dermis and about twice that of whole skin .
this was true for control mice or mice in which ahh was induced by pretreatment with benz ( a ) anthracene .
defects in the biochemistry of collagen in diseases of connective tissue .
the collagens are the major structural glycoproteins of connective tissues .
a unique primary structure and a multiplicity of post-translational modification reactions are required for normal <unk> .
the post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of prolyl and <unk> residues , glycosylation , folding of the molecule into <unk> conformation , proteolytic conversion of precursor procollagen to collagen , and oxidative deamination of certain <unk> and <unk> residues .
any defect in the normal mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules into extracellular fibers could result in abnormal <unk> ; such defects could result in a connective tissue disease .
recently , defects in the regulation of the types of collagen synthesized and in the enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications have been found in heritable diseases of connective tissue .
thus far , the primary heritable disorders of collagen metabolism in man include <unk> hydroxylase deficiency in <unk> syndrome type vi , <unk> peptidase <unk> in <unk> syndrome type vii , decreased synthesis of type iii collagen in <unk> syndrome type iv , <unk> oxidase <unk> in <unk> cutis laxa and <unk> syndrome type v , and decreased synthesis of type i collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta .
some properties of proteolysis by polymorphonuclear <unk> extracts .
the extracts of granules of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes hydrolyzed a variety of proteins including human and bovine hemoglobin , human fibrinogen , human and bovine serum albumin , bovine elastin , and casein .
the hydrolysis of all the proteins except fibrinogen and elastin was increased by addition of urea .
various inhibitors of trypsin , kallikrein , plasmin , clr , cls , and other proteolytic enzymes had no inhibitory effect .
slight inhibition was observed with <unk> sulfonate and strong inhibition with normal human serum .
serum of patients with hereditary <unk> edema having no functional <unk> inhibitor was as effective in inhibiting the proteolysis as normal serum .
the inhibitor was localized in 4s fractions of normal serum fractionated on <unk> <unk> .
fractionation of normal serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation , <unk> <unk> filtration , and <unk> chromatography did not result in appearance of inhibitory activity in more than one protein peak , suggesting the possibility that only one inhibitor might be responsible .
since all fractions which contained the inhibitor of proteolysis also contained <unk> , since sera of patients having low <unk> levels contained less inhibitory activity , and since antibodies against <unk> reversed the inhibition obtained from normal serum , the inhibition of proteolysis may be attributed to <unk> .
inhibition of the antibacterial activity of gentamicin by urine .
urinary levels of antibiotics determine the outcome of treatment of most urinary tract infections .
the antibacterial effect of gentamicin against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in urine was studied .
with use of urinary constituents in concentrations normally found in human urine , it was shown that urine has an inhibitory effect that is dependent upon the acidity and total osmolality of the urine , as well as upon the presence of individual solutes .
up to 40 times as much gentamicin may be needed to prevent the growth of e. coli or p. aeruginosa in concentrated , acidic human urine as is required in broth .
this inhibitory effect may be particularly important when urinary concentrations of gentamicin are reduced either because of a reduction in dosage or because of decreased excretion due to renal insufficiency .
the polysaccharide capsule of bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis : <unk> and morphologic definition .
a <unk> capsular polysaccharide was isolated from strains of bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis .
by means of electron microscopy and staining with ruthenium red , the thick polysaccharide capsule was also visualized .
with use of a radioactive <unk> assay , antibody to this capsular polysaccharide was demonstrated in <unk> prepared in rabbits to each of eight strains of b. fragilis fragilis .
antibody of similar specificity was not found in <unk> prepared to bacteroides <unk> or to strains of bacteroides fragilis subspecies <unk> and bacteroides fragilis subspecies <unk> ; such antibody was found in <unk> to only one of two strains of bacteroides fragilis subspecies <unk> .
the radioactive <unk> assay is a sensitive test for the detection of antibody to capsular polysaccharide .
this polysaccharide antigen may form the basis of a <unk> system for b. fragilis .
<unk> for serum and red cell folate .
a simple , reliable assay for serum and red cell folate is described .
it uses plain untreated liquid or powdered milk , requiring no special handling or purification , as binder .
such milk makes it possible to ignore endogenous serum folate binder , since crude ( but not purified ) milk contains a factor which releases folate from serum binder .
it simplifies counting radioactivity by employing a gamma emitting isotope of <unk> acid ( pga ) , namely the <unk> of pga .
like the <unk> assay of <unk> and <unk> , it permits the use of stable pga rather than unstable <unk> acid ( <unk> ) standards , because it is carried out at ph 9.3 , a ph at which milk folate binder is unable to distinguish pga from <unk> , which is the <unk> folate in human tissues .
the equipment required to do the <unk> is present in most diagnostic chemistry laboratories .
results are essentially identical to the generally accepted lactobacillus <unk> <unk> method of folate assay , except that false low results are not produced in the <unk> by antibiotics , tranquilizers , and chemotherapeutic agents .
three caveats in its use are the relative instability of <unk> as compared to <unk> , the fact that various powdered milks differ widely in <unk> capacity , and that only about 60 per cent of commercially obtained skim or powdered milk preparations appear to contain the substance which splits folate from serum binder .
the effect of environmental ph on glycosaminoglycan metabolism by normal human chondrocytes .
the synthesis and release of sulfated glycosaminoglycans by normal human chondrocytes in culture are markedly affected by environmental ph .
the biosynthetic rate is increased threefold as the ph of the growth medium is raised from 7.0 to 8.0 .
this coincides with a corresponding elevation in total protein and cell growth .
the rate of release of newly synthesized sulfated glycosaminoglycans from the cell layer as well as their distribution between <unk> and extracellular localization in the cell layer is also modulated by environmental ph .
at ph 8 , 35 per cent is found within the cells , this value is reduced to 13 per cent at ph 7 .
<unk> experiments showed that previously incorporated sulfated proteoglycans were released at a faster rate at ph 7 than at ph 8 .
the data suggest that proton concentrations affect the biosynthesis and the mode of distribution of newly synthesized sulfated glycosaminoglycans .
effect of <unk> , pge2 , <unk> on myocardial contractile force .
experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs comparing the effects of <unk> , pge2 , and <unk> on myocardial contractile force ( mc ) .
the three agents were given in successive bolus injections intravenously in <unk> doses and myocardial contractile force was measured by means of a <unk> arch sutured onto the right ventricle .
the drugs were administered before and during ganglionic ( hexamethonium ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) .
both <unk> , and pge2 caused a marked rise in mc , 24 and 20 per cent , respectively , before blockade and 10 and 11 per cent during blockade .
<unk> caused only a minimal rise , 0.9 per cent , before blockade and a marked fall , 27 per cent , during blockade .
<unk> administration during left ventricular bypass indicates that the decrease in mc is not a direct result of alterations in preload or after load .
it is suggested that hypertensive patients treated with autonomic blocking agents may be more susceptible to heart failure in response to <unk> therapy .
<unk> macromolecules in the blood of seriously ill or mentally retarded patients .
this report describes macromolecules that bind ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> ii , the des aspartic <unk> derivative of angiotensin i , and several biologically active and inactive analogues of these polypeptides .
the macromolecules were found in the plasma of approximately 2 per cent of ambulatory adults and hospitalized children and 32 per cent of the patients at two institutions for the mentally retarded .
the binding properties of these macromolecules were studied by incubating with peptides labeled with <unk> , and separating bound from free labeled peptide using small gel filtration columns .
the <unk> macromolecules from several patients were compared .
they showed very similar specificity for a group of <unk> peptides of the <unk> sequence .
the plasma binders differed from one another in their optimum ph and their mobility in electrophoretic fields .
those with more acid ph optima displayed more rapid electrophoretic mobility .
the binders fell into two classes based on apparent molecular weight , approximately 140,000 and 250,000 .
those with the higher apparent molecular weight contained a large proportion of binder that could be precipitated with antiserum to human iga .
kinetic measurements showed that the plasma binders were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to affinity for ( <unk> ) <unk> , with apparent association constants ranging from 10 ( 7 ) to 10 ( 8 ) m-1 .
binding activity was labile to heat , and to treatment with pepsin or trypsin .
it was inhibited by calcium , <unk> , streptomycin , and some other cationic compounds .
the plasma peptide binder differed in specificity and molecular weight from soluble <unk> molecules extracted from tissues , and from properties expected of a receptor for angiotensin .
these macromolecules may be useful reagents for measuring ( <unk> ) <unk> .
their presence in plasma samples may interfere with angiotensin assays in some circumstances .
testicular tumor .
the transmission of impulses in the ectodermal slow conduction system of the sea anemone <unk> parasitica ( couch ) .
1. the ss 1 fatigues in response to repetitive electrical stimulation .
this fatigue is manifested by an increased conduction delay and a decreased ss 1 pulse amplitude .
2. continued repetitive stimulation leads to the failure of the system .
recovery may take many seconds .
narrow strips of column fail more rapidly than wide strips .
3. the increased conduction delay is explained in terms of a decrease in the population of spiking cells .
<unk> a computer model is described and analysed .
it suggests that conduction between electrically coupled ectoderm cells could be the basis for the ss1 .
the ss 1 may have properties not so far experimentally demonstrated ; for example , under certain conditions it could behave as a local system .
colonial conduction systems in the <unk> : <unk> .
1. the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> mirabilis each have a <unk> nerve net .
the nerve net demonstrated <unk> may well be the same as that previously shown by the use of histological techniques .
2. it exhibits both facilitation and <unk> in the rate of conduction of pulses .
3. the distance of spread of nerve net activity is not limited by the number of stimuli applied .
<unk> the nerve net controls fast muscle contractions ; the frequency of pulses is important in determining which muscles contract and in which sequence .
5. the nerve net is <unk> ' active .
<unk> a previously <unk> slow system has been identified in <unk> .
it has many of the properties of slow systems in sea anemones and may well be ectodermal .
it is suggested that multiple conduction systems are of common occurrence in the <unk> .
water regulation by a presumptive hormone contained in identified neurosecretory cell r15 of aplysia .
injection of an <unk> of identified neuron r15 into the <unk> of aplysia produced a weight increase of 3-10 % within 90 min .
control injections of several other identified neurons or of seawater , were ineffective .
the weight increase occurred even when the animals were maintained in 5 % <unk> seawater .
the activity of the r15 <unk> was retained after acidification to ph 2 and heating to 100 degrees c ; but activity was destroyed by proteolytic digestion with <unk> .
dialysis in cellulose dialysis tubing resulted in a significant loss of aion on <unk> <unk> ( nominal exclusion limits <unk> daltons ) , activity was present in the partially included volumes , but was absent in the totally excluded or totally included volumes .
the data support the notion that r15 contains one or more hormones involved in ionic regulation or water balance .
the results of bioassays of r15 extracts subjected to different treatments are consistent with the hypothesis that activity is due to one or more stable polypeptides of relatively low molecular weight .
intracellular ph transients in squid giant axons caused by co2 , nh3 , and metabolic inhibitors .
the intracellular ph ( phi ) of squid giant axons has been measured using glass ph microelectrodes .
resting phi in artificial seawater ( asw ) ( ph <unk> ) at 23 degrees c was 7.32 <unk> 0.02 ( 7.28 if corrected for liquid junction potential ) .
exposure of the axon to 5 % co2 at constant external ph caused a sharp decrease in phi , while the subsequent removal of the gas caused phi to overshoot its initial value .
if the exposure to co2 was prolonged , two additional effects were noted : ( a ) during the exposure , the rapid initial fall in phi was followed by a slow rise , and ( b ) after the exposure , the overshoot was greatly exaggerated .
application of external <unk> caused phi to rise sharply ; return to normal asw caused phi to return to a value below its initial one .
if the exposure to <unk> was prolonged , two additional effects were noted : ( a ) during the exposure , the rapid initial rise in phi was followed by a slow fall , and ( b ) after the exposure , the undershoot was greatly exaggerated .
exposure to several weak acid metabolic inhibitors caused a fall in phi whose reversibility depended upon length of exposure .
inverting the electrochemical gradient for <unk> with 100 mm <unk> had no effect on phi changes resulting from short-term exposure to azide .
a mathematical model explains the phi changes caused by <unk> on the basis of passive movements of both nh3 and <unk> .
the simultaneous passive movements of co2 and <unk> can not explain the results of the co2 experiments ; these data require the postulation of an active proton extrusion and/or sequestration mechanism .
analysis of an <unk> mutant of pseudomonas aeruginosa .
<unk> analysis was applied to the pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant <unk> ( <unk> ) .
this mutant can utilize <unk> as sole source of carbon and nitrogen and has a <unk> increased <unk> dehydrogenase ( hdh ) content ( <unk> , creaser & loper , 1972 ) .
<unk> analysis was carried out using 18 <unk> mutants to see where the <unk> locus maps in relation to the structural genes of histidine biosynthesis .
the <unk> marker <unk> with group iv genes at 97 to 100 % and not at all with group i , which is known to be the structural gene for hdh .
the data obtained in the studies of km ( <unk> ) and km ( nad ) , and the effect of ph and temperature on the hdh activity from <unk> and <unk> are in full agreement with the genetic data that the <unk> mutation is not in the structural gene for hdh .
it is suggested that <unk> may be a mutation in a regulatory gene affecting hdh synthesis in <unk> and may map close to <unk> whose function in histidine biosynthesis is not known .
studies on the rumen flagellate <unk> frontalis .
the vast increase in the population density of the rumen flagellate <unk> frontalis shortly after the host animal has commenced eating is caused by stimulation of a reproductive body on a vegetative phase of the organism to differentiate and liberate the flagellates .
the stimulant is a component of the <unk> diet .
the vegetative stage of n. frontalis bears a strong morphological resemblance to that of certain species of aquatic <unk> fungi , and consists of a reproductive body borne on a single , much branched <unk> .
the flagellates liberated in vivo within 15 to 45 min of feeding lose their motility within i h and develop into the vegetative phase , thus producing a rapid decrease in population density of the flagellates .
conditions for maximum flagellate production are similar to those occurring in the rumen : ph 6-5 , 39 degrees c , absence of o2 , presence of co2 .
differentiation of the reproductive body is inhibited by compounds affecting membrane structure and function , but not by inhibitors of protein synthesis .
the organism was cultured in vitro in an undefined medium in the absence of bacteria or other flagellates .
properties of some bacteriocins produced by rhizobium <unk> .
bacteriocins produced by six strains of rhizobium <unk> were found to be of the relatively low molecular weight , <unk> type .
the molecular weights ranged from approximately 1-8 x 105 to 2-0 x 105 .
all were of protein composition , as indicated by buoyant density ( 1-32 to 1-34 g/cm3 ) in <unk> and by sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes .
they were resistant to <unk> but sensitive to <unk> .
the six bacteriocins could further be separated into two subgroups on the basis of sensitivity to extremes of ph , binding to filter membranes , activity spectrum on sensitive strains of r. <unk> , and possibly mode of action on sensitive bacteria .
<unk> production occurred spontaneously during the <unk> <unk> phase of bacterial growth in broth culture .
hyphal tip bursting in mucor <unk> : antagonistic effects of calcium ions and acid .
production and purification of the gamma <unk> of staphylococcus aureus <unk> 5r ' .
the gamma <unk> of staphylococcus aureus <unk> 5r ' was produced on <unk> agar overlain with cellophane .
maximal yields of crude <unk> with titres of 2000 to 4000 haemolytic <unk> were obtained within 24 h at 37 degrees c in 10 % ( v/v ) co2 in air , on medium adjusted to ph 7-0 .
the crude <unk> was purified <unk> ( with 75 % recovery ) by ultrafiltration , gel filtration and ammonium sulphate fractionation .
the specific activity of the <unk> was 10 ( 5 ) haemolytic <unk> protein after the <unk> active precipitate was extracted with nacl and <unk> with ammonium sulphate .
purified gamma <unk> was homogeneous by disc electrophoresis and <unk> .
basic and neutral amino acid transport in aspergillus <unk> .
arginine and methionine transport by aspergillus <unk> mycelium was investigated .
a single uptake system is responsible for the transport of arginine , lysine and ornithine .
transport is <unk> and specific for these basic amino acids .
the km value for arginine is 1 x 10 ( -5 ) m , and vmax is 2-8 <unk> dry <unk> ; km for lysine is 8 x 10 ( -6 ) m ; kt for lysine as inhibitor of arginine uptake is 12 mum , and ki for ornithine is mm .
on minimal medium , methionine is transported with a km of <unk> mm and vmax about i <unk> dry <unk> ; transport is inhibited by azide .
neutral <unk> acids such as serine , phenylalanine and leucine are probably transported by the same system , as indicated by their inhibition of methionine uptake and the existence of a mutant specifically impaired in their transport .
the recessive mutant <unk> , unable to transport neutral amino acids , was isolated as resistant to <unk> and <unk> .
this mutant has unchanged transport of methionine by general and specific <unk> <unk> .
<unk> acid induced aphid transmission of plant viruses .
aphids transmitted <unk> ( plo ) <unk> tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) when given acquistion and inoculation access periods as brief as 30 s and 2 min , respectively ; the ability to transmit was lost within 90 min .
aphids without claws were able to transmit the virus .
transmission thus seems similar to that of <unk> viruses .
the ratio of virus to <unk> acid , as well as the kcl concentration , markedly affected transmission .
transmission was best from mixtures which contained 250 <unk> tmv , 2-5 <unk> plo ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and 0-6 <unk> .
a similar mixture favoured transmission when <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was substituted for plo , but with <unk> ( <unk> <unk> 30 000 ) it was necessary to decrease the kcl to 0-3 m to obtain transmission .
less kcl ( <unk> to 0-24 m ) also favoured aphid transmission of <unk> potato virus x and tobacco rattle virus .
<unk> tmv <unk> in the presence of , and <unk> in , 0-6 <unk> remained aphid transmissible while <unk> virus in 2 <unk> , which favours greater dissociation of the <unk> complex , was transmissible neither before nor after sedimentation by <unk> , and <unk> in 0-6 <unk> these results show that transmissibility is not due to a permanent alteration of the virus by plo and indicate that the formation of a <unk> complex is required for transmission .
sequential acquisition experiments suggest that plo may act by binding tmv to receptor sites in aphids .
however , the possibility that plo affects the infection process was not ruled out .
disruption of vi bacteriophage iii and localization of its deacetylase activity .
it has been shown that particles of vi bacteriophage iii catalyse deacetylation of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) acid , a structural analogue of vi polysaccharide ( vi antigen ) .
using this substrate , and determining the acetic acid liberated by <unk> <unk> , a method for the estimation of vi phage deacetylase activity has been developed .
purified particles of vi phage iii were exposed to a variety of mildly dissociative reagents and conditions , and then tested for <unk> and for deacetylase activity .
they have also been inspected under the electron microscope .
osmotic shock , and incubation in the presence of ethylenediamine <unk> acid ( greater than or <unk> <unk> m ) , or of l-arginine ( 0-25 m ) , were found to cause disintegration of the virions into empty head capsids , deoxyribonucleic acid , and base plates still carrying the spikes .
the mixtures of viral fragments exhibited an increased deacetylase activity .
using zonal sedimentation and ion exchange chromatography , the phage fragments obtained by treatment with <unk> acid have been fractionated and the base plates isolated .
amongst the viral components , these structures showed the highest specific deacetylase activity .
they had the shape of six-pointed stars ( about 9-5 nm inner , and 14-5 nm outer <unk> ) with a central hole or plug ( approximately 3 nm ) , carrying six spikes , roughly cylindrical organelles of <unk> 11 x 4 nm , one at each of the points .
of the polypeptides of six sizes ( <unk> , about 153,000 daltons ; <unk> , 91,000 ; <unk> , 71,000 ; <unk> 56,500 ; <unk> , 22,000 ) , detected in whole vi phage iii virions by sodium dodecyl <unk> gel electrophoresis , only two , <unk> and <unk> were found in the base plates .
a model to replace psychiatric hospitals .
a comprehensive system of community treatment in southwest denver has reduced the need for adult psychiatric inpatient beds to less than <unk> population .
six small , community-based therapeutic environments , crisis intervention , home treatment , social systems intervention , and rapid <unk> comprise the essential components of this total community care system .
the system operates within a framework of citizen participation and community control , the elimination of formal staff offices , and a focus on working in the real-life setting of the client and his family .
to evaluate the effectiveness of community care , patients about to be hospitalized were randomly assigned to a psychiatric hospital or to community alternative treatment .
outcome measures at discharge and at follow-up completed by the client himself , treatment staff , and family members indicate that community treatment was more effective than psychiatric hospitalization .
biochemical changes in rat brain associated with the development of the blood-brain barrier .
the reaction of choline and <unk> with the <unk> from acetylcholinesterase .
the formation of <unk> by isolated neuronal nuclei .
dynamic changes in regional cbf , intraventricular pressure , csf ph and lactate levels during the acute phase of head injury .
the authors measured regional cerebral <unk> ( <unk> ) blood flow ( <unk> ) , intraventricular pressure ( ivp ) , cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) ph and lactate , systemic arterial blood pressure ( sap ) , and arterial blood gases during the acute phase in 23 comatose patients with severe head injuries .
the ivp was kept below 45 mm hg .
the <unk> was measured repeatedly , and the response to induced hypertension and hyperventilation was tested .
most patients had reduced <unk> .
no correlation was found between average cbf and clinical condition , and neither global nor regional ischemia contributed significantly to the reduced brain function .
no correlation was found between cbf and ivp or cbf and cerebral perfusion pressure ( cpp ) .
the csf lactate was elevated significantly in patients with <unk> lesions , but not in patients with `` pure '' cortical <unk> .
the <unk> clearance curves from areas of severe cortical lesions had very fast initial components called tissue peaks .
the tissue peak areas correlated with areas of early veins in the angiograms , indicating a state of relative <unk> , referred to as <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> was found in all patients with cortical laceration or severe contusion but not in patients with <unk> lesions without such cortical lesions .
the peaks increased in number during clinical deterioration and disappeared during improvement .
they could be provoked by induced hypertension and disappeared during hyperventilation .
the changes in the <unk> areas appeared to be related to the clinical course of the cortical lesion .

nursing deans as leaders in collegiate health professions .
deans of nursing who choose to be administrators of the health sciences may very well enhance nursing programs by facilitating the nursing faculty to become leaders through offering service courses in health , may thereby help to cut the high cost of nursing education , and may make a contribution to other health majors by sharing their <unk> special expertise in health theory .
changing nursing students ' attitudes toward the aged : an experimental study .
studies of the effect of dietary cholesterol on hepatic protein synthesis , reduced glutathione levels and serine dehydratase activity in the rat .
a basal diet or a basal diet plus 1 % of cholesterol and 0.33 % <unk> acid was fed to rats for varying lengths of time and ( 1 ) the activities of liver <unk> ( <unk> ) , tyrosine transaminase ( tt ) , and serine dehydratase ( sd ) ; ( 2 ) the rate of total hepatic protein synthesis and ( 3 ) the concentration of hepatic reduced glutathione ( gsh ) were <unk> .
the specific activity of <unk> was significantly depressed by cholesterol plus <unk> acid feeding , while the specific activity of tt was unchanged .
no significant effect of dietary cholesterol plus <unk> acid was found on the total liver activities .
in contrast , sd specific activity was increased 3-fold .
the rate of ( <unk> ) <unk> incorporation into total tca <unk> protein following ingestion of cholesterol plus acid was significantly reduced when the data were expressed as dpm ( <unk> ) <unk> protein .
after correcting this expression for specific radioactivity of the liver tissue free leucine pool , no significant effect of dietary cholesterol plus <unk> acid on hepatic protein synthesis existed .
in fact , the amount of <unk> incorporated into protein on a total liver basis was 50 % greater for the cholesterol group .
on a per gram of liver basis , the concentration of gsh in the liver of rats fed a cholesterol plus <unk> acid diet was significantly decreased .
considering the liver enlargement in rats fed cholesterol plus <unk> acid , total organ gsh was found to be significantly greater than for rats fed a basal diet .
thiamine <unk> activity of myosin and accelerating effect of thiamine <unk> and <unk> on <unk> of <unk> .
ttp accelerated <unk> <unk> of <unk> in as low a concentration as 30 mum and decreased light scattering by <unk> .
these effects could also be observed in the same way , but to a lesser degree , by addition to tdp .
myosin was able to hydrolyze ttp to tdp , but some important differences were confirmed between myosin <unk> and atpase .
myosin <unk> was inhibited by actin and showed a much larger km than that of atpase .
ttp significantly inhibited myosin b atpase and atp greatly inhibited myosin b <unk> .
these findings suggest that the accelerating effect of tdp and ttp may be due to the binding of thiamine phosphate to the regulatory site of myosin followed by a change in its physical chemical property , rather than due to the competitive binding of thiamine phosphate to the catalytically activity site of myosin .
countercurrent <unk> for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in children .
the meaning of the leydig cell in relation to the etiology of cryptorchidism : an experimental <unk> study .
in our <unk> studies of testicular biopsies , both normal and <unk> , we found a simple atrophy of the leydig cell in the <unk> testis .
based on experiments by <unk> and <unk> on pregnant mice , we tried to find the reason for changes in the leydig cell relating to the etiology of cryptorchidism .
we found on electron microscopic study of testes in the offspring of pregnant mice treated with estrogen the same atrophy of the leydig cell as we see in human cryptorchidism .
these changes are not evident when estrogen and hcg are given together .
we can conclude from this experiment that lack of gonadotropin stimulation leads to the atrophy of leydig cells .
this atrophy then produces a lack of androgen which could be responsible for cryptorchidism .
[ improvement in performances of an apparatus testing membrane resorption in vitro , by automatic adjustment and regulation of ph ] .
[ pharmacokinetics parameters of the gastrointestinal absorption of drugs ( <unk> transl ) ] .
the in vitro adsorption of drugs from horse serum onto carbon coated with an acrylic hydrogel .
in vitro studies have shown that uncoated carbon and carbon coated with an acrylic hydrogel are capable of <unk> drugs from horse serum at 37 degrees .
increase in the coating weight from 2 to 4 % decreased the rate of adsorption but not the total capacity .
in vivo data supports the concept of carbon <unk> for use in the treatment of drug overdose .
the interaction of antihistamines with lecithin monolayers .
the interaction of a series of antihistamines with monolayers of <unk> lecithin has been examined .
an increase in the monolayer surface pressure was noted for monolayers spread on the antihistamine solutions , suggesting penetration of the film by drug molecules .
at high surface pressures there was an apparent ejection of drug molecules from the film .
the ability of the antihistamines to increase surface pressure was correlated with their surface activity at the <unk> interface .
the effect of drug concentration on the magnitude of the surface pressure was examined for diphenhydramine hydrochloride .
application of the gibbs adsorption equation at low surface compressions indicated an approximate area per molecule for diphenhydramine in the film which was in good agreement with the value previously obtained at the <unk> interface .
preliminary measurements showed that the surface pressure increase was larger in the presence of phosphate buffer at ph 6-8 .
it was not clear whether this effect was caused by the buffer components or was a ph effect .
effect of surfactant monomers on chloramphenicol association to an <unk> complex : a model for modified drug absorption .
the binding of chloramphenicol to an <unk> complex in the presence or absence of <unk> concentrations of both ionic and non-ionic surfactants has been examined .
long chain , strong ionic detergents , such as sodium dodecyl sulphate or <unk> bromide , severely perturb protein structure and eventually allow full separation of the complex into lecithin and <unk> complexes .
the dissociation process is reversible upon the removal of the detergent by exhaustive dialysis .
after the splitting of the complex , the amount of antibiotic associated with the <unk> mixture increases .
structural alteration of the <unk> complex and the increase in the binding of chloramphenicol have an effect on the transfer rate of this antibiotic across an artificial barrier consisting of an aqueous dispersion of the same complex , as observed in a model system .
it is suggested that a reversible alteration in membrane structure , and consequently in membrane permeability , might be easily effected , at the molecular level , through a reversible dissociation of structural lipoproteins into their components , operated by <unk> concentrations of ionic surfactants .
this represents a tentative picture of the possible events taking place within the membrane and modifying the absorption rate of a drug , when it is associated with surfactants in a pharmaceutical preparation .
the effect of blending on the rheological properties of gelatin solutions and gels .
the effect of blending on rheological properties for an acid and alkaline processed gelatin has been investigated .
blending of weak gels ( <unk> % w/v at 25 degrees ) , resulted in a decrease in gel rigidity whereas in the stronger gels ( 5-50 % w/v at 25 degrees ) and solutions ( 18 % and 30 % w/v at 35 degrees ) , an increase occurred .
the decrease in structure in the weak gels is considered to be due to coulombic effects , minimum strength occurring for a mixture which possessed zero charge in solution .
a tentative explanation for effects in rigid gels and concentrated solutions is offered .
amphetamine <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
a single dose of ( + ) <unk> ( 8 mg <unk> , i.p. ) administered 4 h before experimentation , reduced the pressor and positive <unk> effects elicited by this drug ( 0-6 mg <unk> , i.v. ) and augmented the rate of the development of <unk> to these responses in the <unk> <unk> preparation .
amphetamine pretreatment reduced the pressor and positive <unk> effects of phenylephrine ( 0-1 mg <unk> , i.v. ) and the positive <unk> effects of angiotensin ( 30 mug <unk> , i.v. ) .
the rate of the development of <unk> to the cardiovascular responses elicited by phenylephrine and angiotensin was augmented by amphetamine pretreatment .
the results suggest that an indirect mechanism ( noradrenaline ) may in part mediate the cardiovascular effects of these 3 drugs and/or that amphetamine may act as a competitive antagonist at <unk> sites .
<unk> interaction in the dog .
the administration of phenylbutazone together with warfarin to dogs resulted in an elevation of the free fraction of warfarin in the plasma from 2-6 to 8-0 % thus providing direct support for the notion that phenylbutazone induced inhibition of warfarin binding to plasma proteins .
this inhibition as evaluated by a kinetic method was accompanied by a two-fold decrease in the plasma half-life of warfarin from 18-4 h in control animals to 9-6 h in <unk> animals .
marked increases in <unk> <unk> were observed when at doses up to 8 mg <unk> ( orally ) it was given with phenylbutazone ( 50 mg <unk> , orally ) .
the unbound fraction of warfarin in canine plasma ranged from 1-7 to 4-3 % indicating individual differences in the extent of the plasma binding of warfarin in the dog .
the effect of pancuronium on myocardial contraction and catecholamine metabolism .
the effects of pancuronium bromide infusion on the uptake and release of [ 14c ] noradrenaline ( <unk> ) by the isolated , perfused rat heart and on the <unk> and inotropic activity of the isolated heart were evaluated .
hearts were removed from animals under light ether anaesthesia , transferred to a modified <unk> <unk> apparatus and perfused with <unk> bicarbonate solution at a rate of 5 ml <unk> .
the effect of pancuronium on the uptake of noradrenaline was determined by <unk> hearts for 5 min with <unk> containing various concentrations of pancuronium and 200 ng <unk> of <unk> .
after 5 min <unk> hearts contained less <unk> .
the degree of reduced uptake increased with increasing concentrations of pancuronium .
in addition , the combination of pancuronium perfusion and electrical stimulation ( 15 ma for 10 ms at 4 hz ) blocked the 50 min uptake of <unk> by the heart to a greater degree than either factor separately .
the release of noradrenaline was determined after <unk> hearts with <unk> followed by perfusion with solution containing pancuronium but no <unk> for 1 h .
pancuronium infusion did not significantly alter the release of <unk> from the heart after 1 h of perfusion .
the infusion of pancuronium caused a reduction in both the rate and strength of myocardial contraction of the isolated heart which was reversed by perfusion with <unk> free of pancuronium .
following perfusion with <unk> the rate and strength of contraction of the heart was seen to `` rebound '' above <unk> values for a short period .
the rebound of myocardial rate and contraction may have been due to the presence of myocardial noradrenaline previously blocked from reuptake by pancuronium since hearts removed from <unk> animals did not demonstrate `` rebound . ''
metabolism of <unk> by the isolated perfused dog lung .
comparison with in vitro liver metabolism .
the metabolism of ( - ) <unk> ( <unk> ) has been studied in the isolated perfused dog lung .
after intravascular administration of [ 3h ] <unk> there was an overall biotransformation of 12 % .
two major metabolites were isolated and identified as <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> was also present together with small amounts of <unk> and <unk> .
an in vitro experiment using a dog liver microsomal preparation was also carried out and showed that the major metabolites were <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> were also isolated together with small amounts of <unk> and <unk> .
the side-chain hydroxylated compounds are hitherto undescribed metabolites of <unk> .
determination of low <unk> of the quaternary ammonium compound <unk> <unk> in plasma and urine .
a sensitive and selective method for the quantitative determination of the quaternary ammonium <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) in plasma and urine is described .
the procedure is based on ion pair extraction of the compound with iodide as the counter ion .
this is followed by gas chromatography using an alkali flame ionization detector .
the detection limit is 2 ng <unk> with a recovery of <unk> <unk> 6-2 % from plasma , <unk> <unk> 4-6 % from urine .
the described method can also be applied to other quaternary ammonium compounds .

kinetics and mechanisms of drug action on microorganisms xxii : effects of <unk> with and without organism pretreatment with bacteriostatic agents .
escherichia coli generation in the logarithmic growth phase was inhibited in peptone broth usp at ph 7.0 without kill below 3.0 <unk> of <unk> .
above this value , the logarithms of the number of <unk> of the <unk> culture ultimately decreased linearly with time and the slopes of these plots were independent of concentration .
a <unk> lag in the time of attainment of the <unk> action was observed , and the extent of this lag was related to the ease of emergence of resistant organisms .
the minimal concentration for <unk> action increased with increasing concentrations of nutrients and with decreasing ph .
pretreatment of the cultures with <unk> and tetracycline lessened the minimum bactericidal concentration of <unk> whereas chloramphenicol pretreatment increased it .
tetracycline pretreatment inhibited the emergence of <unk> organisms .
elementary osmotic pump .
the elementary osmotic pump is a new delivery system for drugs or other active agents ; it delivers the agent by an osmotic process at a controlled rate .
control resides in the : ( a ) water permeation characteristics of a semipermeable membrane surrounding the formulated agent , and ( b ) osmotic properties of the formulation .
in its simplest embodiment , the system is constructed by coating an <unk> <unk> solid agent with the <unk> , semipermeable membrane .
this membrane contains an orifice of critical size through which <unk> agent is dispensed .
the system can contain the agent in solid form at loading higher than 90 % of the total volume , and the agent can be delivered at rates several orders of magnitude higher than can be achieved by solution diffusion through polymeric membranes .
the delivery rate , the fraction of total content delivered at zero order , and the <unk> delivery portal size have been calculated for delivery of a single compound .
experimental work verified the theory .
the release rate from the system was found to be independent of outside agitation when the system is not deformed by shaking action , the ph of the environment , and delivery portal size for sizes within a specified range .
the delivery rate from this system in vitro and in the gi tract of dogs was found to be equal .
new and expedient determination of atenolol in biological samples .
a method is described for the glc determination of atenolol bp in plasma and urine .
extraction is accomplished under dehydrating conditions , and interfering impurities are removed by using an acidified <unk> mixture ( 2:1 ) and <unk> paper disks .
the drug thus isolated appears to react more efficiently with <unk> anhydride , increasing the sensitivity of glc <unk> analysis .
concentrations as low as 0.02 <unk> were measured using <unk> <unk> of plasma or 0.1 ml of urine .
amino alcohols such as atenolol may form hydrates or <unk> , precluding complete <unk> with <unk> anhydride .
time course and dose dependence of antacid effect on urine ph .
daily administration of a proprietary magnesium and aluminum hydroxides suspension , 15 ml four times a day , to normal adult volunteers resulted in a statistically significant increase in urine ph on the 1st day of treatment .
the urine <unk> on the 2nd and subsequent days of treatment were statistically significantly higher than on the 1st day .
a <unk> dose of the antacid suspension , taken four times a day , had only a small and not statistically significant effect on urine ph , while 30 ml four times a day increased urine ph by approximately the same magnitude as the <unk> doses .
the effect of the antacid on urine ph persisted for at least 1 day after discontinuation of dosing .
quantitative analysis of <unk> in blood and urine .
<unk> can be quantitatively measured in whole blood and urine by a technique involving extraction with ethyl acetate , treatment with silica gel , separation by tlc , and quantitative measurement by fluorescent spectrophotometry .
this method has a sensitivity down to 125 ng ( 25 ppb in 5.0 ml of sample ) of free <unk> and shows an average 90 % recovery of <unk> in blood and urine with standard deviations of 9.7 and 7.4 % , respectively .
<unk> secretion of <unk> into saliva .
the relationship between serum and stimulated , mixed saliva concentrations of <unk> was determined in 12 chronically medicated patients .
samples were obtained at times chosen to approximate the maximum and minimum serum concentrations of the drug during a dosing interval .
marked <unk> variability was found in the ratio of saliva to serum concentration of the drug ( <unk> ) .
there was no correlation between the dose ( milligrams per kilogram per day ) and the minimum serum or saliva concentration of <unk> .
saliva ph ranged from 6.3 to 8.0 in eight subjects .
the ratio of saliva to serum concentration of <unk> increased with decreasing ph .
this result can be largely explained by the <unk> ionization and distribution of <unk> , a weak base .
vehicle for stabilizing aluminum hydroxide gel .
sympathetic cardiovascular effects of experimental strychnine poisoning in dogs .
the cardiovascular effects of intravenously administered strychnine were studied in anesthetized and paralyzed dogs .
administration of strychnine in cumulative doses of up to 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg caused significant pressor , as well as positive inotropic and <unk> , effects on the heart which were abolished by adrenergic blocking agents .
the cardiovascular responses possibly were elicited by a central mechanism in contrast to the peripheral inhibitory action of strychnine on the sympathetic system .
diazepam caused a marked attenuation of the pressor response with only slight changes on the heart .
a combination of diazepam and propranolol would appear to be a useful therapy in cases of strychnine poisoning showing marked cardiovascular excitation .
evaluation of the permanent sympathectomy produced by the administration of <unk> to adult rats .
the administration of <unk> to adult rats has been shown by morphological criteria to destroy sympathetic neurons .
the objective of this study was to evaluate by biochemical and functional criteria the degree and permanence of this sympathectomy .
young adult male rats ( <unk> g ) were injected with saline ( controls ) or with <unk> for 5 weeks .
the status of the sympathetic nervous system in the animals was evaluated 1 , 3 and 6 to 7 months after cessation of treatment .
seven months after cessation of treatment ; the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglia of treated animals was greatly reduced , as were the norepinephrine levels in peripheral tissues .
the concentration of epinephrine and the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in adrenals were not different from controls at any of the times studied .
norepinephrine concentrations in several areas of the central nervous system were unchanged .
increases in blood pressure in response to stimulation of the sympathetic vasomotor outflow in the <unk> rat preparation were markedly and permanently reduced in <unk> animals .
isolated intestinal <unk> preparations from <unk> animals usually contracted in response to nerve stimulation , rather than relaxing as in controls .
the response to stimulation of the <unk> nerve in vas deferens preparations was reduced 1 month after cessation of treatment .
the responses of the vas deferens from <unk> and control animals were the same 7 months after treatment despite a 93 % reduction in norepinephrine concentration .
the data demonstrate that the administration of <unk> to adult rats produces a marked and permanent destruction of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system .
mechanism of action of quinidine on squid axon membranes .
the mechanism of action of quinidine on squid axons has been examined by means of voltage clamp and internal perfusion techniques .
when applied either externally or internally , quinidine hcl suppresses both sodium and potassium conductance increases , the effect on the former accounting for the observed decrease in action potential .
the potassium conductance in quinidine undergoes a marked inactivation in a manner dependent upon the membrane potential and time , accounting for the observed prolongation of the terminal falling phase of the action potential .
quinidine <unk> exhibits the effect similar to that of quinidine hcl only when applied internally .
the dissociation constants of quinidine in suppressing the sodium conducting system are estimated to be 2.4 x 10 ( -4 ) and 4.0 x 10 ( -4 ) m for quinidine hcl and <unk> , respectively .
the dissociation constant of quinidine in suppressing the <unk> system decreases with increasing step depolarization .
when applied externally to the intact axons , quinidine hcl is more effective at external ph 8.6 than at 7.3 .
when perfused internally , quinidine hcl is more effective at internal ph 7.0 than at 8.0 , and the potency is related to the calculated internal concentration of the charged form rather than that of the uncharged form .
these results lead to the conclusion that quinidine hcl penetrates the nerve membrane in the uncharged form , is ionized in the axon and blocks the sodium and potassium <unk> primarily in the charged form .
thus , quinidine and local anesthetics share some features in the terms of the site of action and active form .
barbiturates block calcium uptake by stimulated and <unk> rat sympathetic ganglia .
the effects of two barbiturates on calcium uptake by sympathetic ganglia have been examined .
sodium pentobarbital ( <unk> mm ) and sodium thiopental ( 0.3 mm ) block the preganglionic <unk> uptake of <unk> by rat superior cervical ganglia but not action potential conduction in the presynaptic axons .
the <unk> agent , tetraethylammonium , does not inhibit <unk> ca uptake and does not prevent the blocking effect of thiopental .
this effect is therefore probably presynaptic .
<unk> media also stimulate ca uptake by the ganglia , and this effect is markedly inhibited by pentobarbital .
since the k stimulation effect is also observed in <unk> ganglia but not in <unk> ganglia , this effect is probably associated primarily with postsynaptic elements .
in sum , the data suggest that the barbiturates inhibit ca permeability changes in both <unk> and postsynaptic neurons .
mechanism of action of <unk> and acetylcholine on the longitudinal muscle of the canine antrum .
1. electrical and mechanical activities of the <unk> muscle of the dog antrum were recorded with the double <unk> technique .
2. the muscle exhibited spontaneous action potentials which consisted of a spike-like potential which , after a brief and partial repolarization , was followed by a <unk> , <unk> potential .
in 97 % of the preparations , no tension changes were produced by spontaneous action potentials .
3. tetrodotoxin , atropine , <unk> and <unk> antagonists , and h1 and h2 receptor blocking agents had no effect on the action potential .
it was concluded that the action potential was myogenic in origin .
<unk> the mean frequency of the action potential at <unk> 0.5 degrees c was <unk> ( s.e. of mean , <unk> ) and the mean duration <unk> sec ( s.e. of mean , <unk> ) .
5. steady depolarizing current increased whereas hyperpolarizing current decreased the frequency of the action potential .
<unk> <unk> relations were studied .
in twelve strips , the average resting , passive , tension at lo was 570 mg .
the active force of isometric contraction produced by acetylcholine increased with strip length up to a maximum , then decreased wtih further increased in length .
there were no mechanical responses to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> had two sites of action .
on smooth muscle , it increased the frequency of the action potential in a dose dependent fashion .
threshold <unk> ranged from <unk> to <unk> .
the <unk> was <unk> .
the maximum response , <unk> , was reached at <unk> .
<unk> also released acetylcholine from intramural cholinergic nerves .
<unk> <unk> reduced the amplitude and duration of the action potential .
an alkyl <unk> in rat liver .
1. diethyl ether , which is known to be partly metabolized in vivo , has been found to show an o2 uptake with the rat liver microsomal membranes ; a similar reaction is given with other short chain aliphatic ethers , <unk> and <unk> ether .
2. the `` <unk> '' reaction is optimal at ph <unk> and is not accompanied by an increased formation of <unk> .
3. when coa is added to the <unk> together with a source of oxaloacetate and the <unk> enzyme synthase , the <unk> present forms citrate from diethyl ether , indicating an acetylation of coa , which then enters the citric acid cycle .
<unk> similarly to 3 , <unk> is formed from methyl <unk> ether .
5. differing from <unk> , a <unk> does not have to be added as a co-factor .
proceedings : the actions of <unk> on the delayed potassium current in skeletal muscle fibres .
<unk> measurement of the internal ph of crab muscle fibres .
the internal ph of crab muscle fibres was measured using <unk> <unk> <unk> .
immediately following electrode penetration the mean internal ph was 7-21 <unk> <unk> ( s.e. of mean ) and the mean membrane potential was <unk> <unk> 0-6 mv ( s.e. of mean ) .
if <unk> ions were passively distributed across the fibre membrane the internal ph would have been <unk> .
2. the internal ph tended to rise before stabilizing at a mean value of 7-27 <unk> <unk> ( s.e. of mean ) .
the difference between immediate and stabilized values is highly significant and suggests acid injury on electrode penetration .
3. changing the membrane potential or external ph had only small , slow effects on internal ph .
<unk> external co2 caused a large and rapid decrease in internal ph .
with low concentrations of co2 , the effect was dependent on the initial ph as predicted by the law of mass action .
during a long exposure to 2-65 % co2 at ph 7-5 , the internal ph returned slowly to its previous value , suggesting active transport of <unk> ( or <unk> or <unk> ) ions across the fibre membrane .
5. the internal buffering power calculated from the response to 2-65 % co2 was 47-3 <unk> 2-8 <unk> ( <unk> <unk> unit per l. ) ( s.e. of mean ) .
[ adrenergic and cholinergic control of oxytocin release evoked by vaginal , vagal and mammary stimulation in lactating rats ( <unk> transl ) ] .
1. the amounts of oxytocin released during ferguson and <unk> reflexes are estimated by measurements of <unk> pressure .
for the <unk> reflex , the gain in weight of the young over a period of 30 minutes is taken as an indirect index of the release of oxytocin .
2. antagonists of specific <unk> and <unk> were injected into the third ventricle in order to delineate the role of the mediators and receptors in the control of oxytocin release .
3. the results suggest that three reflexes have a specific chemical transmission since : a ) the ferguson reflex is inhibited by the drugs that only block alpha and beta <unk> .
b ) the <unk> reflex is inhibited by the drugs that block alpha and beta <unk> and muscarinic <unk> .
c ) the <unk> reflex is inhibited by the drugs that block alpha <unk> and muscarinic and nicotinic <unk> .
proteins in the luminal fluid from the bovine oviduct .
<unk> fluid was collected by <unk> from four cows and by irrigation from fifteen slaughtered cows .
the proteins in the fluid were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at ph 4-5 and ph 8-9 , isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide , <unk> , <unk> , affinity chromatography and gel filtration .
the macromolecular components found were mainly serum proteins but small amounts of other proteins were detected in <unk> and <unk> samples by electrophoresis at ph 8-9 following fractionation of the fluid by gel filtration or affinity chromatography .
small amounts of <unk> migrating proteins were detected directly by electrophoresis at ph 4-5 in <unk> samples but not in <unk> samples .
determination of <unk> activities revealed that the levels at oestrus were similar to the levels detected in serum .
at <unk> , the activities of <unk> and <unk> were elevated .
boar seminal <unk> protein and the <unk> .
about 30 % of boar seminal plasma nitrogen is maximally precipitated at room temperature by 6 to 10 mm zinc in citrate solution at ph 8 .
a rise in the total nitrogen precipitated by 1 to 6 mm zinc is accompanied by a fall in the <unk> titre of the supernatant fluid .
at 6 mm zinc addition , 95 % of the <unk> is precipitated , but much of this is recoverable by <unk> of the zinc precipitate .
protein profile studies by <unk> chromatography of the zinc precipitate solution reveals a mixture of proteins , some of which are not by themselves <unk> .
effect of season on some characteristics of stallion semen .
season had a pronounced effect upon seminal ph and refractometer <unk> ' , total carbohydrate , dry weight , total n2 and lactic acid in seminal plasma of first and second ejaculates .
in addition , total seminal volume , spermatozoa per ml and per ejaculate , non-protein <unk> and <unk> of second ejaculates were also influenced .
there was a season difference in the concentrations of lactic acid in spermatozoa from first and in total n2 from spermatozoa in second ejaculates .
the effects of season on seminal plasma were greater than those on spermatozoa .
spermatozoa in first ejaculates were less affected by season than those in <unk> ejaculates .
this differential effect on first and second ejaculates was generally true of all seminal characteristics .
influence of ejaculation frequency of stallions on characteristics of semen and output of spermatozoa .
approximately 1 week was required to stabilize the <unk> sperm reserves in stallions ejaculated daily for 10 weeks .
the true daily sperm output of a stallion was equal to the mean daily sperm output of seven ejaculates <unk> 1-35 x 10 ( 9 ) spermatozoa .
mean concentrations of <unk> and number of <unk> were higher ( p less than <unk> ) for x1 and <unk> ejaculation frequencies than for a <unk> frequency .
sperm <unk> was nearly identical for a <unk> frequency .
sperm <unk> was nearly identical for the x3 and x6 frequencies and higher ( p less than <unk> ) than the x1 frequency .
increase of ejaculation frequency from one to two <unk> twice weekly significantly ( p less than <unk> ) raised the output of <unk> .
<unk> semen volume , <unk> , and number of <unk> were higher ( p less than <unk> ) in the first , than in the second , ejaculate .
collection of semen on alternate days would be a practical ejaculation frequency for inseminating mares .
two ejaculates collected twice a week would be a practical ejaculation frequency for long-term storage of stallion semen .
transfer of gases and metabolites in the equine placenta : a comparison with other species .
mares and fetuses with indwelling catheters in the umbilical and uterine vessels have been used to monitor <unk> blood gas tensions , ph , o2 affinities and the concentration of various metabolites in fetal and maternal blood during late gestation .
measurements of umbilical and uterine blood flows and <unk> differences enabled the uptake of o2 and glucose by the fetus and the uterus to be estimated .
the present findings are compared with those from other species in comparable conditions .
androgens and <unk> in normal and <unk> stallions .
total androgens , testosterone and total <unk> were measured in twenty-one intact , nine unilaterally <unk> , three bilaterally <unk> stallions and four geldings .
total <unk> were significantly higher ( p less than <unk> ) and total androgens significantly lower ( p less than <unk> ) in the bilateral <unk> compared to other groups .

the clinical course of 40 patients with <unk> was reviewed to determine prognostic factors and response to treatment .
the first three months were the most critical to survival .
survivorship was 57 per cent at five years .
older age of onset , involvement of skeletal muscle and presence of peripheral neuropathy weighted against a satisfactory outcome .
cutaneous vasculitis was associated with a more benign course .
myocardial disease , central nervous system involvement , or hypertension were not invariably poor prognostic factors .

2. synthesis and adrenergic activity of some <unk> <unk> and <unk> ring analogs of <unk> .
the synthesis of <unk> analogs in which the phenyl ring is replaced by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> was accompanied by conversion of the corresponding aldehydes to the <unk> followed by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride .
a <unk> useful synthesis of <unk> is described utilizing the <unk> of methyl <unk> to benzene followed by reduction to the alcohol and oxidation with <unk> .
all compounds , as their hydrochloride salts , exhibited indirect adrenergic activity on the rat vas deferens .
on the <unk> rat vas deferens all compounds potentiated the effects of exogenous norepinephrine .
the results are in agreement with the conclusion that the more saturated the ring moiety , the greater the affinity for the amine uptake site of the vas deferens and suggest that there is no important interaction between the drug and this uptake site that involves <unk> formation .
<unk> restricted analogs of histamine h1 receptor antagonists : trans and <unk> .
the syntheses of <unk> and <unk> ( 1 and 2 ) are described .

the cis compound 2 is a more effective inhibitor of histamine n-methyltransferase than the trans isomer 1 .
synthesis and <unk> blocking action of <unk> ions derived from <unk> and <unk> .
crystalline perchlorate salts of <unk> ions derived from <unk> and <unk> were prepared .
both <unk> ions were tested on the rat vas deferens and found to possess <unk> potencies which were nearly identical with those of the parent compounds .
the hydrolysis rates of <unk> and <unk> <unk> ions ( 2a , b ) in physiological medium were found to be 6.0 4 x 10 ( -4 ) and 8.35 x 10 ( -4 ) <unk> , respectively .
the rates of cyclization of the parent amines to 2a and 2b in aqueous medium were 1.9 x 10 ( -2 ) and 7.2 x 10 ( -3 ) <unk> , respectively .
the potencies and kinetic profiles indicate that the <unk> ion is the only active species in <unk> blockade .
moreover , differences in potency between <unk> and <unk> appear to be exclusively to a difference in receptor affinity rather than to a difference in intrinsic alkylating ability .

ii .
reaction of glycine with adenosine <unk> and p1 , <unk> .
when a solution containing <unk> and imidazole is evaporated to dryness and then maintained at a temperature between 65 degrees c and 100 degrees c , high yields of appa and <unk> are obtained .
we believe that impa is formed first , and then activates the carboxyl group of glycine or <unk> .
if glycine , atp or appa , and imidazole are heated together in the solid state , impa is formed and atp , or indirectly from imidazole and <unk> .
next the carboxyl group or glycine is activated by the impa formed in situ .
the subsequent reactions of activated glycine leads to the formation of <unk> and the 2 ' ( 3 ' ) <unk> of pa .
under plausible <unk> conditions , good yields of <unk> up to the octamer can be obtained from glycine , atp and imidazole .

comparison of condensing agents .
a reaction which <unk> nucleotides under possible prebiotic conditions has been characterized .
nucleoside monophosphate in the presence of cyanamide at acid ph condenses to form <unk> pyrophosphate and phosphodiester bonded compounds .
imidazole compounds and activated precursors such as nucleoside triphosphate are not necessary for this <unk> reaction which produces primarily cyclic <unk> .
formation of nucleoside <unk> from nucleotides and <unk> .
when solutions of nucleoside <unk> and <unk> are dried out at room temperature , nucleoside <unk> are formed .
the <unk> ion shows a superior catalytic function in this reaction when compared with other divalent metal ions .
starting with nucleoside <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , the predominant products in the nucleoside <unk> series <unk> are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
nucleoside <unk> yield <unk> and <unk> , nucleoside <unk> give <unk> and <unk> .
the <unk> relevance of these reactions is discussed .
on the possible role of organic <unk> polymers as matrices for prebiotic activity .
one of the major diagenetic pathways of organic matter in recent sediments involves the condensation of cellular constituents , particularly amino acids and sugars , into insoluble <unk> polymers .
these polymers consist mainly of humic and <unk> acids and make up the major part of the organic carbon reservoir in recent sediments .
we suggest that a similar set of reactions between <unk> formed amino acids and sugars , and more generally between aldehydes and amines , occurred on a large scale in the prebiotic hydrosphere .
the rapid formation of this insoluble polymeric material would have removed the bulk of the dissolved organic carbon from the primitive oceans and would thus have prevented the formation of an `` organic soup '' .
<unk> polymers have several properties which make them attractive hypothetical precursors of contemporary oxidation-reduction coenzymes : 1. they contain heterocyclic nitrogen compounds similar to the nitrogenous bases ; 2. they contain a high concentration of stable free radicals ; and 3. they tend to concentrate those heavy metals which play prominent roles in contemporary <unk> redox processes .
the prebiotic formation of similar polymers could , therefore , have provided the starting point for a basic class of biochemical reactions .
we suggest that the prebiotic scenario involved chemical and <unk> reactions at the <unk> interface in relatively shallow waters and under conditions not much different from those of the recent environment .
hemoglobin function in the vertebrates : an evolutionary model .
comparative data on quaternary structure , cooperativity , bohr effect and regulation by organic phosphates are reviewed for vertebrate hemoglobins .
a phylogeny of hemoglobin function in the vertebrates is deduced .
it is proposed that from the monomeric hemoglobin of the common ancestor of vertebrates , a <unk> dimer , as seen in the lamprey , could have originated with a single amino acid substitution .
the <unk> dimer has a bohr effect , cooperativity and a reduced oxygen affinity compared to the monomer .
one , or two , additional amino acid substitutions could have resulted in the origin of a tetrameric <unk> hemoglobin which dissociated to dimers on oxygenation .
gene duplication , giving incipient alpha and beta genes , probably preceded the origin of a tetrameric <unk> .
the origin of an organic phosphate binding site on the tetrameric hemoglobin of an early fish required only one , or two , amino acid substitutions .
atp was the first organic phosphate regulator of hemoglobin function .
the binding of atp by hemoglobin may have caused the original elevation in the concentration of atp in the red blood cells by relieving end product inhibition of atp synthesis .
the switch from regulation of hemoglobin function by atp to regulation by dpg may have been a consequence of the curtailment of oxidative phosphorylation in the red blood cell .
the basic mechanisms by which atp and dpg concentrations can respond to <unk> on the oxygen transport system were present before the origin of an organic phosphate binding site on hemoglobin .
a switch from atp regulation to <unk> regulation occurred in the common ancestor of birds .
aminoacyl transfer from an adenylate anhydride to <unk> .
imidazole catalysis of <unk> transfer from phenylalanine adenylate anhydride to the hydroxyl groups of <unk> was investigated as a chemical model of the biochemical <unk> of trna .
imidazole catalyzed transfer of phenylalanine to poly ( u ) increases from ph 6.5 to 7.7 and decreases above ph 7.7 .
at ph 7.7 approximately 10 % of the <unk> residues are transferred to poly ( u ) .
at ph 7.1 , transfer to poly ( u ) was five times as great as to poly ( a ) and transfer to a poly ( a ) poly ( u ) double helix was negligible .
at ph 7.1 approximately 45 mole percent linkages to poly ( u ) were monomeric phenylalanine ; the remainder of the linkages were peptides of phenylalanine .
the number of linkages and their lability to base and neutral hydroxylamine indicates that phenylalanine and its peptides are attached as esters to the 2 ' hydroxyl groups throughout poly ( u ) and the 2 ' ( 3 ' ) hydroxyl groups at the terminus of poly ( u ) .
these results do model the contemporary process of aminoacyl transfer to trna and continue to suggest that a histidine residue is in the active site of <unk> .
<unk> strain reaction .
i. comparative mortality in <unk> and parental strain male and female mice .
lethally irradiated male and female hybrids , parental strains , and the third party strain a mice were inoculated with reciprocal hybrid marrow from donors of the same sex .
a graft-versus-host reaction was produced against <unk> antigens of reciprocal hybrids .
although the late mortality in inbred strain males was generally greater than that of females , without further tests this difference was not automatically attributable to an x or a y chromosome disparity .
hybrids did not recognize the qualitative difference in <unk> of their reciprocals , but they were able to recognize the quantitatively greater <unk> of their parental strains , and a <unk> strain reaction occurred .
the graft-versus-host reaction in the third party strain a mice was significantly more severe than that produced by hybrid marrow in their reciprocal hybrid recipients , but significantly less severe than that produced in the parental strains .
the relationship between <unk> and responsiveness was such that the severity of the graft-versus-host reactions masked the maternal influences observed with other reciprocal hybrids .
graft versus leukemia .
vi .
adoptive immunotherapy in combination with <unk> for spontaneous <unk> in akr mice .
a three-step treatment plan incorporating adoptive immunotherapy and <unk> was used to treat akr ( <unk> ) mice bearing spontaneous <unk> ( sll ) .
1 ) leukemic mice were treated with <unk> for immunosuppression and leukemia <unk> .
2 ) to introduce a <unk> reaction against residual malignant cells , the immunosuppressed akr mice were given immunocompetent cells from h-2 mismatched <unk> ( <unk> ) donors .
3 ) to `` rescue '' the akr hosts from incipient graft-versus-host disease , the mismatched <unk> cells were killed with combination chemotherapy , and cells from allogeneic h-2 matched rf ( <unk> ) donors were administered to restore hematopoiesis .
leukemic akr mice thus treated had significant prolongation of their median survival time and a higher 60-day survival rate post treatment than did untreated controls , <unk> controls , or control mice that received <unk> plus cells from <unk> donors .
therefore , adoptive immunotherapy may be useful as an adjunct to conventional therapy for treatment of sll in akr mice .
a study of tobacco carcinogenesis .
xiii .
<unk> <unk> of the weakly acidic fraction .
the weakly acidic fraction ( waf ) of cigarette smoke particulate matter was <unk> by silica get chromatography .
we assayed the various primary <unk> for potential <unk> activity by measuring the incorporation of <unk> thymidine into mouse epidermal dna as induced by these <unk> .
based on these results and on chemical composition , the primary <unk> , were then combined into four major <unk> and tested on initiated mouse skin for <unk> activity by long-term application .
two of these <unk> ( 40 % of waf ) were inactive , whereas the other two ( 18 and 35 % of waf ) showed <unk> activity .
the two active portions were then further <unk> and tested by the short-term bioassay .
some major components of the resulting active fractions included <unk> , <unk> , hydroquinone , fatty acids , and <unk> .
among these components , catechol , hydroquinone , <unk> , <unk> , linolenic acid , and linoleic acid were inactive as tumor promoters in the experimental animal .
the activity of the <unk> is unknown .
other components remain to be identified .
metabolic characteristics of cells infected with a herpesvirus of turkeys .
chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with the <unk> herpesvirus of turkeys ( <unk> ) displayed an increased rate of glucose uptake , a pronounced alteration of the ph of the medium , and an increased production of lactic acid when compared to <unk> cultures .
objective estimates of cytopathology ( quantifiable neutral red uptake and cell protein determination ) showed that cell deterioration was a slow process in <unk> cells when compared to infection by herpes simplex virus .
experiments with irradiated host cells demonstrated that <unk> required functional cell dna for replication .
the inactivation of the necessary host cell function displayed multihit kinetics .
in agreement with data on other herpesviruses , <unk> damaged by uv light could be <unk> in chick cells .
the results indicate that <unk> shares biologic properties in common with other herpes and transforming viruses .
control of mercury pollution .
when a <unk> ( no3 ) 2 solution was kept at 25 degrees c in glass or polypropylene containers , 50 and 80 % of original radioactivity was adsorbed to the containers ' walls after 1 and 4 days , respectively .
however , no loss in radioactivity was observed if the solution was supplemented with <unk> as carrier ( 100 mug <unk> ) and stored in either container for 13 days .
when <unk> was dissolved in glucose basal salt broth with added carrier , levels of <unk> in solution ( kept in glass ) decreased to 80 and 70 % of original after 1 and 5 days and decreased even more if stored in polypropylene ( 60 and 40 % of original activity after 1 and 4 days , respectively ) .
in the absence of carrier , decreases of <unk> activities in media stored in either container were more pronounced due to <unk> ( but ) not diffusion .
the following factors affecting the removal of <unk> from aqueous solution stored in glass were examined : type and concentration of adsorbent ( fiber glass and rubber powder ) ; ph ; pretreatment of the rubber ; and the form of mercury used .
rubber was equally effective in the adsorption of organic and inorganic mercury .
the ph of the aqueous <unk> solution was not a critical factor in the rate of adsorption of mercury by the rubber .
in addition , the effect of soaking the rubber in water for 18 hr did not show any statistical difference when compared with <unk> rubber .
it can be concluded that rubber is a very effective adsorbent of mercury and , thus , can be used as a simple method for control of mercury pollution .
<unk> deacetylation of carcinogenic <unk> by tissue <unk> of the dog and other species .
the relative ability of <unk> deacetylase enzyme systems of dog liver to carry out the deacetylation of the carcinogens , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , was examined .
the <unk> were incubated with unfortified dog liver <unk> , and enzyme activity ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was estimated by colorimetric quantitation of the resulting <unk> .
the dog liver enzyme system displayed characteristics similar to those described for the rodent liver enzyme system in that enzyme activity was greatest in liver tissue , was localized in the microsomal subcellular fraction , required no cofactors , and was inhibited by heat , sodium fluoride , and thiol reagents .
in five replicate assays , the relative rates of deacetylation were about 10 , 6 , and 1 with <unk> ( 84.8 <unk> 12.4 ) , <unk> ( 52.5 <unk> 5.1 ) , and <unk> ( 8.8 <unk> 3.3 ) , respectively .
as a canine urinary bladder carcinogen , <unk> is considered more potent than <unk> , while <unk> is devoid of detectable carcinogenic activity , despite the fact that <unk> is a well-established canine urinary bladder carcinogen .
removal of the acetyl group may be a requirement for urinary bladder carcinogenesis ; accordingly , the present studies demonstrate the appearance of a direct relationship between dog liver deacetylase enzyme specificity and urinary bladder susceptibility to these carcinogenic <unk> .
renal chromium accumulation and its relationship to <unk> nephrotoxicity .
this report is an attempt to study the renal handling of chromium under in vitro conditions and to relate this to the actions of the ion in the production of nephrotoxicity .
renal slice techniques were employed in these studies and were used to examine the effects of chromium on various renal transport processes .
in addition , the accumulation of chromium by the renal tissue has also been studied .
marked accumulation by renal cortical slices of the rat was observed when <unk> chromate or dichromate was added to the bathing solution .
some metabolic inhibitors interfered with this uptake process ; in addition , some substrates metabolized by renal tissue reduced the accumulation of <unk> .
the use of [ <unk> ] dichromate and [ <unk> ] <unk> , as well as alterations in the bathing solution ph , indicated that in the rat chromium can interfere with renal transport processes , but that the oxidation state of this metal is not important .
on the other hand , in the rabbit a greater interference with <unk> uptake was noted at lower bathing solution phs .
this is interpreted to mean that chromate is the effective inhibitor in this species .

bacterial shock .
sodium bicarbonate administration during cardiac arrest .
effect on arterial ph pco2 , and osmolality .
arterial ph , pco2 , and osmolality were determined serially during cardiac resuscitation in patients and in dogs , with and without administration of sodium bicarbonate .
these studies demonstrate that ( 1 ) in the absence of preexisting acidosis , severe acidosis can be prevented by adequate ventilation alone ; ( 2 ) sodium bicarbonate administration results in a significant rise in arterial pco2 , which parallels the rise in ph despite adequate ventilation ; ( 3 ) during prolonged cardiac and resuscitation , there is a rise in arterial osmolality that is accentuated by sodium bicarbonate .
these studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate should not be used during resuscitation ( 1 ) in the absence of effective hyperventilation or where carbon dioxide removal is inadequate despite adequate ventilation , ( 2 ) in repeated doses , without confirmation of substantial acidosis , or ( 3 ) when cardiac arrest has been of brief duration and preexisting acidosis is unlikely .
these studies also point to the need for a reappraisal of other buffers that do not elevate the arterial pco2 .

<unk> anomalous rectification of frog sartorius muscle .
the membrane site responsible for anomalous rectification was determined in frog sartorius muscle fibers .
the total current-voltage relation of <unk> fibers which represents mainly the properties of the sarcolemma was linear for membrane potentials between about -90 and -50 mv .
thus moderate <unk> anomalous rectification in intact fibers represents a property of the <unk> system .
the absence of slow hyperpolarization in <unk> fibers was caused by the abolition of early conductance increase , and the <unk> system is responsible for the inward rectifier .
<unk> selectively inhibited both moderate <unk> anomalous rectification and <unk> early conductance increase .
this suggests that the same component in the <unk> system is responsible for these conductance changes .
the inhibition with <unk> of moderate <unk> anomalous rectification suggests the possibility that it is caused by an <unk> effect rather than a decrease in k conductance .
a <unk> <unk> slow conductance increase was revealed .
properties of <unk> delayed rectification in <unk> fibers of frog sartorius muscle .
total current-voltage relations were analyzed on nine <unk> surface fibers of frog sartorius muscles in <unk> isotonic normal ringer solution .
the results indicate that delayed rectification occurs in the sarcolemma on large depolarization and that delayed rectification is only partially inactivated during 1 sec of depolarization and not converted into anomalous rectification .
the time to peak , the time course of inactivation and the potassium activation potential determined in <unk> fibers were comparable to those analyzed previously in intact fibers .
the value of the conductance increase during delayed rectification in <unk> fibers appeared to be smaller than that in intact fibers .
<unk> slow conductance increase of frog sartorius fibers during hyperpolarization .
the properties of the <unk> <unk> slow conductance increase in frog sartorius muscle fibers have been investigated using <unk> acid disodium salt ( edta ) and propionate ringer solution .
more than 1 sec was required for maximum activation of the <unk> <unk> conductance increase .
it is suggested that , although the <unk> slow conductance increase was affected by deterioration , the conductance increase is not a direct product of deterioration but it represents a property of the sarcolemma which is encountered in physiological range .
the <unk> conductance increase was rather insensitive to the change in ph of ringer solution .
it is inferred that the absence of bellying in newly penetrated intact fibers at neutral and alkaline phs is caused mainly by the shunting effect of large parallel conductance .
apparent augmentation with edta of the <unk> conductance increase infers that ca ions affect the conductance increase .
the conductance increase occurred also in the <unk> <unk> solution .
the <unk> slow conductance increase has been compared with the change in cl conductance reported by hutter and warner , and warner .
effects of antidepressant drugs on <unk> <unk> in rats .
effects of antidepressant drugs on the <unk> <unk> induced by stimulating the amygdala in rats implanted with chronic electrodes , were investigated in correlation with <unk> effects as well as neurotoxicity .
tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline , imipramine and <unk> markedly depressed both <unk> and <unk> at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses .
the effect of <unk> was also the same as tricyclic antidepressants .
on the other hand , methamphetamine and <unk> blocked the <unk> at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses without depressing the <unk> <unk> .
major tranquilizers , chlorpromazine and clozapine depressed both <unk> and <unk> only at doses larger than those which impaired <unk> performance .
haloperidol , on the contrary , depressed the <unk> without selectively blocking the <unk> .
minor tranquilizers , diazepam and chlordiazepoxide did not block the <unk> at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses , although they showed a marked depression of the <unk> .
effects of several beta-blockers on blood pressure in the rat .
effects of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on blood pressure in the rat were studied .
also effects of these three <unk> agents on blood pressure and heart rate in spinal rats during adrenaline infusion were studied and compared with those of propranolol .
the <unk> agents produced a sustained pressor action in the rat , and in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline .
the magnitude of the pressor action induced by the beta-blockers was in the following order : <unk> larger than or equal to propranolol larger than or equal to <unk> greater than <unk> .
minimum doses of these beta-blockers required to cause a pressor action in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline were in the following order ; <unk> greater than <unk> larger than or equal to propranolol larger than or equal to <unk> .
the magnitude of the pressor action produced by the same dose of these beta-blockers and minimum doses of these beta-blockers required to cause a pressor action in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline seemed to be roughly proportional to their <unk> blocking activities .
it was concluded that the minimum doses of these beta-blockers required to cause a pressor action and the magnitude of the pressor action induced by the beta-blockers in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline could be used to compare their <unk> activities and that <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , seems to block not only cardiac <unk> but to some extent also peripheral vascular <unk> .
the clinical use of dopamine in the treatment of shock .
dopamine is a direct-acting catecholamine with a short half-life that has many advantages in treating visceral hypoperfusion states such as shock and refractory heart failure .
unlike other inotropic drugs , dopamine directly dilates the mesenteric , renal , and cerebral vessels and redirects blood flow to essential viscera .
this dopaminergic effect is prominent with doses of <unk> <unk> in adults and is attenuated by <unk> and haloperidol .
at doses of <unk> <unk> , dopamine also has a significant beta-adrenergic , inotropic effect , increasing myocardial contractility .
the inotropic effect is equivalent to that of <unk> , epinephrine , and norepinephrine , but tachycardia , <unk> , and angina may be less frequent with dopamine .
in doses greater than 1400 <unk> , dopamine is a vasoconstrictor with pressor effects usually equivalent to that of norepinephrine .
dopamine dilates pupils , does not dilate bronchi , and does not shunt blood from viscera to skeletal muscles as does <unk> .
because dopamine increases myocardial contractility , selectively redistributes perfusion to essential viscera and allows a pharmacologic titration of effect , it is a logical first-choice catecholamine for treatment of shock and refractory heart failure .

[ certain indicators of histamine and histidine metabolism in chronic coronary insufficiency ] .
[ certain problems of treatment of ischemic heart disease ] .
on the basis of extended personal experience and of the literature data , the authors give recommendations for differentiated rational drug therapy of different stages of ischaemic heart disease .
the results of a study of comparative efficacy of 15 <unk> drugs used in 709 patients with ischaemic heart disease are presented along with their clinical pharmacology , side effects , indications and <unk> .
the conclusions were arrived at on the basis of an objective clinical and laboratory study of the effect of the drugs .
the methods of evaluation of the <unk> efficacy and of the selection of patients for the administration of adequate therapy are described , which permits to use these recommendations for practical purposes .
some problems of the pathogenesis of ischaemic heart disease are discussed in terms of the selection of <unk> therapy .
[ stimulators of beta-adrenergic structures in treatment of ischemic heart disease ] .
the beneficial effect of stimulators of beta-adrenergic structures ( <unk> on the <unk> and the inotropic function of the myocardium was demonstrated experimentally ( in 12 rabbits ) and clinically ( in 53 patients with ischaemic heart disease ) .
a positive effect of the treatment was noted in 45.5 % of those patients in whom ischaemic heart disease manifested itself in angina <unk> and angina of effort .
[ <unk> -- a new drug for treatment of ischemic heart disease ] .
data on the pharmacology of a new <unk> drug -- <unk> -- are presented .
<unk> was found to increase the blood flow intensively and for long periods of time , increasing the oxygen reserve of the myocardium , thus increasing the cardiac output and the contractile function of the heart .
the prevailing action of <unk> on the blood supply and the function of the myocardium seems to be the result of several mechanisms : decreasing resistance of the <unk> due to the activation of the <unk> structures ; influence upon the <unk> factors of the regulation of the coronary circulation ( changes in the metabolism and cardiac activity due to the excitation of the beta-adrenergic structures ) .
the mechanism of the positive effect of <unk> upon the blood supply and function of the heart is connected with its action on the adrenergic processes .
the drug accumulates noradrenaline in the myocardium and increases the activity of <unk> .
this coincides in time with the increased blood supply and contractile capacity of the heart .
the <unk> agents prevent these effects .
it was postulated that the effect of <unk> in the blood supply and the activity of the heart is connected with its ability to utilize the energy reserve of the myocardium by way of switching over to the anaerobic way .
[ <unk> and <unk> in treatment of chronic coronary insufficiency ] .
in a double blind study of the clinical effect of <unk> conducted in 55 patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease a positive effect was obtained in 80.4 % of the cases , an effect of <unk> 24.3 % .
<unk> was especially effective in patients with localized <unk> of the coronary arteries .
<unk> ( an activator of the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors ) proved effective in 10 of 13 patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease .
[ effect of certain drugs , used in treatment of chronic coronary insufficiency , on adenosine metabolism ] .
it has been demonstrated that the study of the activity of <unk> and <unk> permits to interpret the metabolism of adenosine .
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> influence the adenosine metabolism favouring an elevation of its content .
the therapeutic effect of <unk> is not conditioned by the `` adenosine '' metabolism .
renal response to short-term <unk> in man .
this study examines the renal response to moderate hyperventilation in healthy man .
eight men hyperventilated for 26 hr ( <unk> approximately 30 to 32 mm hg ) in <unk> ( barometric pressure , pb approximately 740 mm hg ) and <unk> hypoxia ( pb <unk> mm hg ) .
anaerobic samples of arterial blood and urine were studied at two-hour intervals .
plasma [ <unk> ] fell with time during sustained <unk> and after 26 hr was reduced 2.5 <unk> , with plasma ph compensated approximately 60 % .
statistically significant changes in renal <unk> handling were observed within the initial 2 hr of hyperventilation and were evident over the first 12 hr .
over 26 hr , mean total <unk> in <unk> was 10.2 <unk> above control and mean total acid excretion ( <unk> + <unk> ) was 17.5 <unk> below control .
an increased urinary excretion of cations , especially sodium , accompanied the decrease in acid excretion .
plasma lactic acid accumulation was negligible .
we conclude that renal mechanisms contribute significantly and relatively quickly to plasma ph compensation during the early phase of adaptation to <unk> in man .
[ the influence of <unk> on the hydrodynamics and <unk> of the eye ( <unk> transl ) ] .
by animal experiments and clinically we could prove that <unk> instillation caused the decrease in iop due to both increase in outflow and reduction of humor secretion ; the iop decrease and changes in hydrodynamics being manifested more markedly in the <unk> .
as <unk> demonstrated `` <unk> '' produced lumen narrowing in the anterior portion of the uveal tract .
`` <unk> '' was prescribed to 20 patients having <unk> , two hours after instillation the 23 decreased in 26 eyes ( of 28 ) by 9.3 <unk> 1.0 mm hg .
when prescribed regularly `` <unk> '' raised the outflow facility coefficient from 0.10 <unk> 0.01 to 0.20 <unk> .
the secretion decreased from 2.0 <unk> 0.2 to 0.9 <unk> 0.15 .
thus , iop decrease after `` <unk> '' is accounted for by both improved outflow and reduction of aqueous humor secretion .
the `` <unk> '' instillation produced a rather moderate decrease in the total arterial pressure , though no expected parallelism in arterial and intraocular pressure was marked .
[ the immediate effect of <unk> on the internal ocular pressure in patients with chronic simple glaucoma ( <unk> transl ) ] .

in none of the 54 eyes was the <unk> higher after administration of the drug .
on the contrary , the <unk> was <unk> or highly significantly reduced for more than 2 hours , probably because of the <unk> component of the preparation .

[ model of an ecological system closed as regards gas metabolism and with a periodically working autotrophic <unk> i. conditions for stability of the atmospheric system ] .
the paper describes a semi-closed ecological system consisting of a man and a photosynthetic autotrophic component .
the conditions required to maintain the stability of the atmosphere in the system are described as applied to two alternating modes of the function of the autotrophic component .
these conditions express equal quantities of oxygen and carbon dioxide consumed and produced by the components of the system during any time period the length of which is the duration of the cycle of the system .
on this basis equations have been derived which help to identify the photosynthetic cultures that can be used as an autotrophic component in a closed <unk> life support system .
[ microbiological aspects of the performance of life support systems during prolonged operation ] .
the environmental control system using <unk> , <unk> or synthetic <unk> is capable of purifying the atmosphere from microorganisms .
the air conditioning system is another means for air purification from microorganisms .
the possibility of microbial build-up and multiplication in the atmospheric condensate makes it necessary to assume that an air conditioning system may contribute to the transfer of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms in a space cabin .
the reliability of a life support system may degrade due to an accumulation of microorganisms in its components .
further extensive studies are needed to clarify this problem .

the paper describes a model of an experimental ecological system consisting of autotrophic and heterotrophic components and a nutrient medium .
the system has a zero stationary state and needs a correction .
the life time of the system and the level of the necessary correction have been determined for the experimental ecological system : lettuce - slugs - nutrient solution .
optimal conditions for the conjugation of trophic components of the system have been established .

[ control of mineral nutrition of higher plants in biological life support systems ] .
control of mineral nutrition of higher plants is one of the problems involved in the development of life support systems .
the experiments on carrots cultivated <unk> have demonstrated that mineral nutrition of plants can be controlled by means of a correction solution applied in accordance with the protocols derived from experimental studies of increase in the plant dry biomass .
[ model of an ecosystem closed as regards gas metabolism and with a periodically working autotrophic <unk> ii. stability of the periodic cycles ] .
the literature data concerning the effect of the atmosphere composition on the photosynthetic productivity of an intensive <unk> culture were used to build a mathematical model of a <unk> ecological system working in the <unk> alternating cycles .
the type of the relationship between time cycles and composition of the stationary atmosphere of the ecological system has been established .
the conditions of the existence and stability of the stationary atmosphere have been determined .

[ comparative evaluation of results of <unk> femur osteotomy and conservative hip joint <unk> treatment in <unk> disease ] .
in this paper the comparative evaluation of the results of the surgical and conservative treatment applied in patients with <unk> disease is given .
the results obtained with <unk> femur osteotomy performed in 39 patients and those obtained in 66 patients with conservative treatment are reported .
the results are evaluated from the point of view of the patients ' age , the localization of the process and the stages of the disease .
the surgical treatment brought about in 1/3 of the cases <unk> 1/3 good - and in 1/3 unsatisfactory results .
int the group of patients who received conservative treatment 1/3 of the cases showed excellent - 1/5 of the cases good - and 3/5 of the cases unsatisfactory results .
the advantage of the <unk> treatment is that the patients are not confined to bed for long time and they must nol use walking splint releasing the <unk> .
[ respiratory insufficiency in severely burned patients ] .
the increasing number of respiratory insufficiency , as well as of pulmonary complications after burns and their role in the post-traumatic mortality are pointed out by the author .
the pathophysiological processes responsible for the development of post-traumatic pulmonary complications are shortly resumed .
in respect of the clinical picture , three groups are distinguished by the author .
one case is reported in detail .
in the development of post-traumatic respiratory insufficiency important role is attributed by the author to the syndromes of <unk> .
this supposition is supported by the laboratory examination of 10 patients .
finally the problems of prevention and therapy are discussed and the importance of the iatrogenic damages is emphasized .
[ past and present management burns ] .
the management of burns consists essentially of the surgical removal of the necrotic skin layers and the substitution of the skin defects .
secondary skin transplantation does not prevent completely the <unk> and all complications of the burn .
the management of burns is partially classed among the problems of the conservative therapy .
early excision excludes the danger of demarcation and infection , and immediate transplantation may prevent the destruction of the subcutaneous skin layers .
this advantages are assured in the cases concomitant with partial necrosis by xenotransplantation .
[ skin substitution in neck and facial burns ] .
the surgeon assuming the task of reconstruction of burned face must be skilled in plastic surgery .
primary surgical treatment and reconstruction are inseparable , therefore it is desirable that the treatment is performed since the day of the injury to the completion of the reconstruction by the same surgeon .
in the surgical management of the facial burns relative conservatism is advisable .
the excision is to be performed after the recovery of the second-degree burned areas .
the above-mentioned principles are documented by the author on the basis of a few cases .
[ experience with the treatment of open fractures ] .
the number of the injuries and of the open fractures is steadily increasing .
these latter are regularly due to traffic accidents .
characteristics of the open fractures are the extended lesion of the soft parts and the <unk> fractures .
the <unk> depends on the <unk> general state , the extension of the lesion of the soft parts , the contamination and the infection of the wound , as well as on the localization and the type of the fracture .
in the case of proper indication the <unk> yields satisfactory results , but it is not always to be performed and its use to exposed to dangers .
the conservative treatment assures good results , if the lesion of the soft parts is minimal , the reduction of the dislocation is easily <unk> and the bone ends are to be held together .
on the other hand , the method is unsuitable , if extended lesion of the soft parts occurs , as well as in the treatment of <unk> fractures .
in this group of the open fractures we must try to find other , new methods .
[ presence of foreign body in hand and foot , diagnosed too late ] .
on the basis of 7 years ' material , the distribution of 73 foreign bodies - of non-metallic intensity - in the hand and the foot is discussed .
the foreign bodies did not appear as new , fresh lesions , but they have been diagnosed after longer or shorter <unk> state .
in the case of <unk> process immediate removal has been performed , and in the case of closed cases - on the basis of the clinical picture - immediate removal - or removal after fixation for a few days was effective .
in the <unk> opinion , fixation is - so long as acute symptoms are present - in all cases indispensable , - fixation is immediately followed by <unk> , in order to assure good functional results .
[ therapeutic principles and results in the management of open fractures of the tibial ] .
in open fractures of the leg , in which because of any reason no primary stable <unk> can be performed , threading with kirschner wire is preferred by the authors .
this method assures adaptation stability , with minimal <unk> .
primary closure of the wound in the soft parts is striven by the authors , - if necessary , even by plastic surgery .
if primary healing of the wound is obtained and also the other conditions are favourable , the treatment after 7-10 days is the same as after covered fractures : stable <unk> is performed .
on the other hand , if <unk> of the wound occurs , the opposing fixed <unk> bone ends assure favourable conditions for the successful surgical treatment of the fracture .
a further advantage of the method is that it may be performed without special instruments and without greater surgical experience .
the results obtained with this surgical treatment of open leg fractures in the 4 years ' material of the <unk> department of the first surgical clinique of the university medical school , pecs , are discussed by the authors .
[ infectious complications of primary <unk> in aged patients ] .
in respect of iatrogenic infections the elderly patients are to be considered as endangered .
modern traumatology increases this danger in consequence of the foreign materials placed in the wounds .
the role of the antibiotic and chemotherapeutic prophylaxis is of utmost importance .
regrettably , the resistance of the <unk> , especially of the strains in the hospitals is increasing , - in consequence , besides the maximal sterility the further improvement of the surgical technique and of the <unk> are the most important tasks .
in the case of infection aimed antibiotic and chemotherapeutic , <unk> , treatment may be successful .
[ soft tissue complications and their reconstruction following <unk> of open tibial fractures ] .
the nowadays accepted principles of the treament of open leg fractures are discussed .
the open character of the lesion multiplies the possibilities of complications .
in the present paper the complications of the bone recovery are not dealt with , only the complications observed in the soft parts and the possibilities of their treatment are analysed by the authors .
according to the severity of the soft parts complications free transplantation of <unk> skin , pedicle flap <unk> , <unk> graft <unk> , crossed flap grafting , as well as the primary and secondary variations of these methods are used by the authors .
the satisfactory results obtained with these methods even in spite of the complications are pointed out by the authors .
[ experience with the treatment of open leg fractures ] .
open leg fractures observed in 81 patients are analysed by the authors .
in case of conservative treatment alone and in the group , which has been treated with primary <unk> satisfactory results have been observed by the authors .
false joint and osteomyelitis happened only in the group , in which the patients obtained firstly conservative treatment and in the case of the failure of this treatment <unk> has been carried out .
in the authors ' opinion the most frequent complications are due - besides the damage of the soft parts - to the repeated and sometimes erroneous interventions .

[ primary <unk> <unk> ] .
the surgical treatment of a severe injury in the cubital region of a <unk> , aged 47 , is reported .
because of the extended contamination and the splintered fracture radical wound excision - involving also the <unk> surfaces - has been performed and <unk> <unk> <unk> was carried out .
the skin defect has been successfully treated secondarily by insert of a flap .
after uneventful recovery the patient could resume his work 6 months after the injury again .
[ xenograft in the treatment of burns ] .
the injury due to burns embraces three , nearly concentric zones .
the <unk> of the central and marginal zones is reversible and the <unk> - assuring biological ligature - plays important role in turning for better of the process .
the preparation and use of xenograft - applied in the <unk> department - is discussed .

mosquito-borne arboviruses in arctic america .
mosquito-borne arboviruses are prevalent throughout subarctic regions of canada and alaska , principally in the boreal forest extending between latitudes 53 and 66 degrees n , but they have been identified in tundra regions as far north as 70 degrees n .
all mosquito-borne agents have been <unk> , comprising principally the snowshoe hare subtype of california encephalitis ( ce ) virus , but also northway virus .
mosquito vectors comprise several aedes species and <unk> inornata , all of which have supported replication of ce virus following incubation at 13 degrees c or lower temperatures .
isolation of virus from wild-caught larvae points towards <unk> transfer .
principal vertebrate reservoirs of infection are mammals , especially snowshoe hares ( lepus americanus ) and ground squirrels ( <unk> undulatus ) .
where the boreal forest merges into prairie grassland around 53 degrees n , culex <unk> mosquitoes become prevalent , and an <unk> , western equine encephalomyelitis , is detected more frequently than ce virus .
overwintering of mosquito-borne viruses .
the significance of mosquito longevity and <unk> behaviour in the dynamics of arbovirus infections .
mosquito longevity and <unk> behaviour are very important but neglected factors in the dynamics of arbovirus infections as changes in them affect transmission rates exponentially .
some mosquito species feed on a narrow range of vertebrates , some on a wide range , both influenced by <unk> and other environmental and behavioural factors .
only those which feed on maintenance hosts contribute to maintenance of the infection .
some species change their feeding pattern with season .
the frequency of <unk> depends inter alia on environmental temperature .
longevity is perhaps most important : the majority of mosquitoes infected probably do not survive long enough to become infective ; it is influenced by relative humidity , temperature and predation .
longevity , feeding frequency and the extrinsic incubation period are all temperature dependent and are therefore important rate determinants in seasonal epizootics or epidemics .
equally , their relative stability in the tropics contributes to the equilibrium of an enzootic or endemic .
properties of semliki forest virus nucleocapsid .
the nucleocapsid of the semliki forest virus is composed of 34 % rna and 66 % protein , or one rna and about 240 capsid protein molecules .
the particle is spherical , with a diameter of 38 -- 39 nm .
if the nucleocapsid is exposed to slightly acid ph ( 6.4 -- 5.6 ) it undergoes a structural change and is contracted to a 32 nm state .
a similar contraction can be effected by rnase treatment , in this case , however , in connection with a loss of rna .
treatment of the nucleocapsid with 0.2 mm sds results in dissociation of capsid protein from rna , an effect which suggests strong <unk> interaction .
at 0.05 mm sds the protein remains associated with the rna , but the <unk> is reduced from 150 s to 100 s .
electron micrographs of the 100 s ribonucleoprotein showed irregular and <unk> structures .

regulatory function of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the mitochondrion in <unk> .
the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase from freshly isolated mitochondria was shown to be dependent upon the nutritional and metabolic state of the animal prior to sacrifice , such that mitochondria from the livers of 48 hr starved , diabetic , or high fat fed rats had lower enzyme activity than normal , chow fed rats .
the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the rate of <unk> were shown to correlate to a certain extent when a reconstituted , cell free system consisting of 105,000 x g supernatant of rat liver and isolated mitochondria was used .
this system was employed so that the role of the mitochondrion and pyruvate dehydrogenase in <unk> could be investigated .
<unk> increased the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased the rate of <unk> , suggesting that the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is an important factor in determining the rate of <unk> in the reconstituted system .
it was observed , however , that <unk> was more effective in stimulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase than the rate of <unk> when mitochondria from starved animals were used to reconstitute <unk> .
furthermore , the cytoplasmic adenosine <unk> diphosphate ratios and phosphorylation potentials ( <unk> x pi ) maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals were found to be significantly lower than those maintained by mitochondria isolated from chow fed animals .
it is proposed that the lower `` energy pressure '' maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals severely limits <unk> at the atp requiring steps of the process .
studies in vitro of <unk> in rat testicular tissue .
testicular tissue was shown to contain the full complement of enzymes required for de novo synthesis of fatty acids .
the enzymes capable of <unk> palmitic acid from citrate , acetate , or acetyl coa were found to be present in the soluble ( cytoplasmic ) fraction .
these included fatty acid synthetase , acetyl coa carboxylase , <unk> enzyme , malic enzyme , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , and <unk> dehydrogenase .
optimal conditions for assaying activities of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl coa carboxylase in the soluble fraction from rat testes were established , and the activities of these two enzymes were determined to be 0.54 <unk> 0.1 and 0.030 <unk> 0.002 ( <unk> of substrate incorporated into fatty acid per min per mg of soluble fraction protein ) , respectively .
the activities of <unk> enzyme , malic enzyme , and the glucose-6-phosphate <unk> dehydrogenase pair were also measured .
the activities were 6.0 <unk> 0.7 , 34.9 <unk> 4.2 , and 29.9 <unk> 9.3 <unk> , respectively .
fatty acid synthesis from <unk> in rat testis mitochondrial and cytosol fractions in vitro .
an in vitro system for acetate incorporation into fatty acids by the mitochondrial and the cytosol fractions of rat testis is described .
the rate of incorporation of acetate into fatty acids was twice as fast with the mitochondrial as with the cytosol fraction ; both systems were stimulated in the presence of adenosine triphosphate , reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate , coenzyme a , and <unk> ( 2 ) .
the optimum ph was between <unk> for the mitochondrial fraction and between <unk> for the cytosol fraction .
radio gas chromatography showed that palmitic acid was the most highly labeled acid , followed by stearic acid , in the mitochondrial fraction in accord with the pathway of de novo fatty acid synthesis .
some of the labeled acetate was also incorporated into the 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids of this fraction .
distribution of radioactivity among the mitochondrial lipid classes was highest in the phospholipids and <unk> , followed by <unk> and cholesterol ; little radioactivity was present in the triglyceride fraction .
these observations are in accord with studies of the incorporation of labeled metabolites into testicular lipids following <unk> injection and indicate the validity of the in vitro system for studies of specific reactions occurring in vivo .
fat metabolism in higher plants : metabolism of medium chain fatty acids .
cell free preparations of avocado mesocarp and spinach leaf tissue rapidly convert lauryl coa to <unk> lauric acid as well as <unk> , and <unk> acids .
the conversion does not occur under anaerobic conditions unless a suitable redox carrier such as ferredoxin is present .
h2 18o is incorporated into the <unk> function , but o2 ( 18 ) is not .
the characteristics of this system are presented and a possible function of this system is proposed .
<unk> desaturase activity in mammary adenocarcinomas carried by <unk> mice .
transplantable mammary adenocarcinomas and livers of <unk> mice fed a stock diet or a <unk> rich diet ( 15 % corn oil ) contain similar amounts of <unk> ( ca 3 <unk> tissue ) .
on feeding either a high carbohydrate , fat free or a high carbohydrate , saturated <unk> ( 15 % hydrogenated coconut or cottonseed oil ) diet for 6 weeks , <unk> levels increased 2-fold in tumor and 5-fold in liver .
the specific activity of <unk> desaturase in liver <unk> was similar to that in the corresponding fractions of mammary glands of lactating mice .
in liver , this activity was enhanced <unk> to 3-fold by feeding a high carbohydrate , fat free or a high carbohydrate , saturated fat diet .
the desaturase activity in mammary tumor <unk> , while only 10 % of that in hepatic <unk> , remained unaltered regardless of the type of diet fed .
these observations suggest that ( a ) a major portion of the <unk> in the mammary tumor is not produced within the tissue , ( b ) dietary adaptation is not a general characteristic of <unk> desaturase in neoplastic tissues , and ( c ) enhanced desaturase activity in liver is directly related to the absence of <unk> or <unk> , or to a large decrease in <unk> in the diet .
iowa wrestling study : changes in the urinary profiles of wrestlers prior to and after competition .
during the 1973 and 1974 state high school wrestling championships , urine samples were obtained from wrestlers prior to the weigh-in , immediately before they wrestled , and immediately after the subjects had completed their match .
specific gravity , osmolarity , ph , sodium and potassium determinations , as well as qualitative tests for protein and ketones , indicated that the wrestlers were in a dehydrated state at the time of weigh-in .
after the five hour interim between the weigh-in and the first match , all but the ph measure remained essentially unchanged .
this absence of significant changes in the urinary profile suggests that the wrestlers were unable to rehydrate during the five hour time period between the weigh-in and the first match and that they were competing in a dehydrated state .
urine samples collected after competition were significantly lower in specific gravity , osmolarity and potassium concentration than samples obtained before the match .
the urinary potassium levels were of interest because at the three conditions ( weigh-in , before the first match , after competition ) they were <unk> % higher than values reported for high school students who were <unk> .

vasculitis with hepatitis b <unk> : long-term observation in nine patients .
the development of generalized necrotizing vasculitis in association with hepatitis b <unk> is the first example in man of a chronic rheumatic disease presumably caused by a viral infection .
this report reviews the experience in nine <unk> cases of hepatitis <unk> necrotizing vasculitis followed for up to six years .
the natural history of the disease is emphasized and the manifestations of patients with vasculitis who carry hepatitis b antigen are compared with those of vasculitis patients who are antigen negative .
polyarthritis , <unk> and hepatitis b .
an association between viral hepatitis and two rheumatic disease syndromes has been observed .
twenty-nine patients manifested a transient polyarthritis , sometimes associated with a rash ( group i ) .
ten patients were seen with a multisystem disease ( group ii ) .
histologic evidence of arteritis or glomerulonephritis was present in seven of ten patients with multisystem disease .
liver tissue from 18 patients showed morphologic evidence of hepatitis with viral features in 9 of 10 patients in group i and in 6 of 8 patients in group ii .
hepatitis b surface antigen ( <unk> ) and/or antibody to <unk> were detected in sera of all 39 patients .
abnormal liver functions were present in 36 .
twelve group i patients and 2 group ii patients became jaundiced .
rheumatoid factor was present in sera of seven patients in each group .
the third component of complement ( c3 ) was depressed in 13 patients in group i and 7 patients in group ii .
the fourth component of complement ( c4 ) was decreased in 8 of 21 group i and 3 of 7 group ii patients .
synovial fluid c3 was decreased in 2 of 11 group i and 1 of 4 group ii <unk> fluids .
articular inflammation in patients with transient polyarthritis responded in three to seven days to aspirin , <unk> and/or bedrest alone and rashes disappeared spontaneously .
patients with multisystem disease generally had a prolonged illness and responded somewhat unpredictably to prednisone or a combination of prednisone and cyclophosphamide .
some evidence for aldosterone action on <unk> level in human red cells .
in healthy male subjects aldosterone excretion and plasma renin activity were reduced by a 4-6 hr <unk> immersion in <unk> water baths ( 35.5 <unk> 0.1 degrees c ) .
the red cell <unk> ( dpg ) concentration before and throughout immersion period was positively correlated both with aldosterone excretion in 2 hr pooled urine ( r = <unk> ; 2 p less than 0.001 ) and with renin activity ( r = + 0.54 ; 2p less than 0.001 ) despite a concomitant increase of cubital venous ph and inorganic phosphate concentration .
these findings furnish evidence for a regulatory role of aldosterone in dpg metabolism , possibily by a direct influence on red cell glycolysis .
[ alcohol dehydrogenase activity of <unk> purple bacteria ] .

the highest amount of lower alcohols is utilized by the strains of <unk> palustris .
only <unk> <unk> accumulates methanol .
alcohol dehydrogenase of <unk> palustris , <unk> viridis , and <unk> rubrum requires for its activity nad , that of <unk> <unk> -- nadp , and the enzyme of <unk> <unk> is active in the presence of <unk> <unk> ( pms ) and ammonium ions .
aldehyde dehydrogenase from two strains of <unk> palustris also requires nad ; the nakamura strain is active in the presence of pms .
aldehyde dehydrogenase of <unk> <unk> is active in the presence of pms and ammonium ions .
different bacterial species vary in the substrate specificity of their alcohol dehydrogenases .
[ development of mycobacterium <unk> and its synthesis of <unk> under conditions of varying acidity of the medium ] .
mycobacterium <unk> 121 grows and synthesizes <unk> at the initial values of ph of the medium from 5.0 to 11.5 .
the accumulation of biomass is maximal ( 10 to 12 <unk> ) at ph 6.0 to 11.5 ; the rate of growth is highest at ph 8.0 to 11.5 .
the largest amount of <unk> ( 2.0 to 2.4 <unk> ) is produced in the medium at ph 8.0 to 11.0 ; the rate of its production is highest at ph 9.0 to 11.0 .
the growth of mycobacterium <unk> 121 and the biosynthesis of polysaccharide are optimal at ph 8.0 to 8.2 .
changes in acidity of the medium have no effect on the qualitative composition , structure , and molecular weight of the polysaccharide .
[ effect of <unk> and <unk> ions on the physiological and biochemical properties of a pseudomonas <unk> culture ] .
the growth of pseudomonas <unk> was inhibited by unfavourable values of ph in the conditions of <unk> ; the rate of the substrate assimilation was higher , and anabolic and catabolic reactions were decoupled .
hydrogen ions inhibited the activity of enzymes of the krebs cycle , hydroxyl ions inhibited the activity of methanol dehydrogenase .
changes in ph are presumed to involve the energy apparatus of the cell membrane .
[ factors causing lysis of an actinomyces <unk> culture , the producer of the antibiotic , <unk> ] .
the lysis of actinomyces <unk> producing <unk> during its mass growth can be caused by two factors which were separated by differential centrifugation .
the first factor is phage particles of a temperate phage produced by the culture ; they are incapable of growth but may induce the lysis .
the phage particles treated with low ph and a temperature of 70 degrees c lose the lytic activity .
the second factor is a lytic enzyme produced under the control of the temperate phage during its induction ; it seems to consist of at least two enzymes , a lytic enzyme and a proteolytic enzyme .

[ pulmonary vascular pressures and blood gases in young patients with thoracic scoliosis ( <unk> transl ) ] .
pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressures were measured at rest and during exercise in 25 young patients with moderate to severe scoliosis .
simultaneous determinations of arterial blood gases and ph were performed .
the results of the vascular pressure measurements were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy young subjects .
in all patients the pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressure were normal at rest .
during mild ergometer exercise , however , an abnormal rise in pulmonary artery pressure occurred in 9 patients .
moreover , an increased diastolic pressure gradient across the pulmonary vascular bed was found in some <unk> patients indicating an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance .
it is supposed that this haemodynamic abnormality is primarily due to a restriction of the pulmonary vascular bed .
relationships between pulmonary artery pressure and arterial oxygen tension and blood ph , respectively , could be found .
the possible significance of these results is discussed .

role of hyperkalemia in the metabolic acidosis of isolated <unk> .
we studied the relative importance of hyperkalemia and mineralocorticoid deficiency in the metabolic acidosis of a patient with proved isolated <unk> <unk> and moderate kidney failure .
the hyperkalemia and acidosis were severe in relation to the slight <unk> .
despite the systemic acidosis and urinary ph of 4.9 , urinary ammonium excretion was distinctly blunted .
correction of the hyperkalemia by <unk> exchange resin alone resolved the acidosis and restored the previously diminished urinary ammonium excretion to normal .
administration of <unk> only partially corrected the hyperkalemia and the acidosis .
hyperkalemia by itself , rather than <unk> per se , caused the acidosis in this patient .
hyperkalemia apparently suppresses urinary ammonium excretion and thus interferes with urinary acidification .

comparison of properties between virulent and attenuated strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus .
strains of transmissible gastroenteritis ( tge ) virus possessing different pathogenicity were examined for stability to digestive enzymes and acid , and growth at various temperatures .
in growth experiments , virus titer obtained at 37 degrees c were about equal between attenuated and virulent strains , but titers attained by the attenuated strain were higher at 30 degrees c .
the attenuated virus multiplied at 28 degrees c , but the virulent virus did not at this temperature .
the virulent virus was significantly stable to trypsin and pepsin , but the attenuated virus was inactivated rapidly by these proteolytic enzymes .
no significant differences were observed in stability to acid between the attenuated and virulent strains .
at different ph , both lost their infectivity more rapidly at 37 degrees c than at 22 degrees c .

the suspension culture of <unk> cells was proved satisfactory for propagation of ibaraki virus .
the viral titer reached a maximum of 10 ( 6.75 ) <unk> ml .
the input multiplicity ranging from 0.003 to 3.0 exerted no influence on the final yield of the virus .
the optimal ph value of initial culture ranged from 6.8 to 7.6 .
in comparison of virus yield per cell among the suspension culture and two methods of monolayer culture in stationary and rolling condition , there was no noticeable difference in it among the three methods .
the cell population per unit volume was the largest and , therefore , virus titer in the culture fluid the highest in the suspension culture of the three methods .
studies on the mechanism of the action of morphine on the peristalsis of guinea pig ileum in situ .
the influence of some drugs on the effect of morphine on the threshold pressure required to elicit peristalsis in the guinea pig ileum in situ was studied , in order to test the hypothesis that this effect of morphine is mediated by catecholamine release .
<unk> to this effect of morphine was confirmed .
<unk> with two 8 mg/kg doses of reserpine , 24 and 48 hrs before the experiment , significantly reduced the effect of morphine on the pressure threshold .
the i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg <unk> re-established the effect of morphine in <unk> animals to the level of the untreated controls .
pretreatment with <unk> ( 15 mg/kg ) decreased and even prevented this effect of morphine .
<unk> pretreatment ( 10 mg/kg ) also significantly inhibited the effect of morphine .
neither dci nor propranolol influenced this morphine effect .
pretreatment with reserpine , <unk> or <unk> reduced the basic pressure threshold needed to elicit peristalsis .
the possibility that the decrease of local circulation induced by <unk> would reduce the local concentration of morphine was rejected because the same doses of <unk> or <unk> did not modify the effect of hexamethonium given i.v. in this preparation .
all these results support the idea that the effect of morphine on intestinal peristalsis is mediated by a catecholamine acting on <unk> , e.g. norepinephrine .
effects of <unk> acids upon insulin secretion and metabolism of isolated pancreatic islets .
in <unk> isolated pancreatic islets <unk> acid ( kic ) or <unk> acid ( kc ) induced a high insulin secretion rate and a steep increase of the fluorescence of reduced pyridine pyridine nucleotides [ nad ( p ) h ] which fell again to almost <unk> levels 6 min after medium change .
insulin release in response to <unk> ( ko ) acid started slowly and was accompanied by a decrease of the nad ( p ) <unk> trace .
<unk> which is known to initiate insulin release also caused a fluorescence decrease .
<unk> ( kiv ) acid or pyruvate had no significant effects upon insulin secretion or nad ( p ) <unk> .
in contrast to <unk> , <unk> or <unk> did not enhance insulin release or fluorescence of nad ( p ) h .
kiv , <unk> acid ( <unk> ) , kic and kc raised the production their corresponding amino acids by islet cells .
from these results it is concluded that <unk> acids as such trigger insulin release by acting upon receptor sites which differ from those occupied by amino acids .
norepinephrine reward pathways : role of <unk> , memory consolidation , and schizophrenia .
the preparation and properties of nerve growth factor protein at alkaline ph .
the nerve growth factor ( ngf ) subunit of 7s ngf was isolated by chromatography at high ph on <unk> .
it has the same specific ngf activity as <unk> isolated at acid ph , showing that this activity is an intrinsic property of the subunit and is independent of the pathway of dissociation .
continued exposure of the ngf subunit to high ph resulted in an increase in the amount of the minor species <unk> and the formation of a new species , <unk> , of even lower isoelectric point .
these two species and the original major species of the preparation , <unk> , were isolated by isoelectric focusing .
all three species had the same specific ngf activity , but differed in their ability to reform 7s ngf .
the <unk> species was one-fifth as competent as <unk> , while <unk> was unable to regenerate 7s ngf .
addition of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> decreased the amount of ngf protein required to produce one biological unit of activity in the bioassay , but had no effect when added to <unk> .
the interactions between the subunits in 7s ngf therefore determine , in part , the specific activity of the ngf subunit .
<unk> <unk> <unk> from rat brain glycoproteins .
the affinity of <unk> a for neutral and acidic <unk> derived from rat brain glycoproteins was investigated by studying the inhibition of a <unk> <unk> precipitation system .
the neutral , <unk> <unk> obtained by column electrophoresis of the <unk> <unk> that had been <unk> by proteolytic treatment of defatted brain tissue were powerful inhibitors , with an inhibitory activity 20 to 26 times that of the standard inhibitor , <unk> .
the acidic <unk> had activities one to nine times that of the <unk> .
therefore , both acid and neutral <unk> were capable of interacting with <unk> a .
the especially strong affinity of the neutral <unk> <unk> , however , enabled their retention on <unk> <unk> and subsequent elution with <unk> .
this provided the means of separation of the acidic <unk> from the neutral , <unk> <unk> by affinity chromatography .
<unk> that contain <unk> are not retained by <unk> <unk> .
the use of hybrid molecules in a study of the equilibrium between nerve growth factor monomers and dimers .
the major protein in beta nerve growth factor preparations , <unk> , is a dimer in which both peptide chains have <unk> arginine residues .
digestion of <unk> with carboxypeptidase b produced a dimer , <unk> , in which both chains lack these terminal arginine residues .
exposure of mixtures of <unk> and <unk> dimers to 8 m urea to produce monomers , followed by removal of urea to allow recombination , resulted in the formation of the hybrid <unk> , comprising one <unk> and one <unk> chain , as well as the parent dimers .
the amount of the three dimers formed was close to that expected from random association of monomers .
hybrid <unk> was also formed from mixtures of <unk> and <unk> where incubated at ph 2.6 to 4.5 .
the formation of <unk> has a half-time of 6 h at ph 4.0 and 4 degrees c .
its rate of formation decreased above ph 4.5 , becoming minimal between ph 9.5 and ph 10.5 , and increased with increasing temperature .
the amount of <unk> formed was determined by the lowest ph to which the parent mixture was exposed , irrespective of its prior history .
these data suggest that the hybrid is formed by the same mechanism in the absence and presence of the urea step .
an approximate value for kd , the equilibrium dissociation constant of the dimer equilibrium monomer equilibrium was derived .
its value was 3 - 10 ( -10 ) m at ph 4.0 and 4 degrees c .
the <unk> of 7s ngf decreased the rate of formation of <unk> not only at phs where an <unk> complex is stable , but also at an acid ph where no complex formation is observed by sedimentation analysis , suggesting that the present methodology offers a more sensitive probe of subunit interactions .
in contrast , the gamma subunit and a number of indifferent proteins had little or no effect on the appearance of <unk> at the phs studied .
changes in hypothalamic neurotransmitter uptake following <unk> , superior cervical <unk> or melatonin administration to rats .
rats subjected to <unk> or to <unk> plus bilateral superior cervical <unk> exhibited depressed serotonin uptake by hypothalamic <unk> ; norepinephrine , dopamine or glutamate uptake was not affected by any of the surgical procedures .
treatment with melatonin resulted in inhibition of hypothalamic serotonin accumulation but it did not modify the uptake of norepinephrine , dopamine or glutamate .
these data suggest a relationship between the pineal gland and the <unk> nerve endings of the hypothalamus .

hypercapnia in metabolic alkalosis .
<unk> maleate ( <unk> ) in the treatment of essential hypertension .
the antihypertensive activity of <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a new beta blocking agent , was assessed in a single blind crossover placebo-controlled study in 14 patients with essential hypertension .
ten patients completed the trial .
the average standing pressure during the placebos periods was <unk> and during the periods on treatment with <unk> the average standing pressure was <unk> .
all 10 patients showed some hypotensive response .
the average daily dosage was 21 mg with a range of 15-30 mg .
four patients achieved optimal levels of blood pressure by the end of one <unk> therapy with the maximum time required being four weeks .
<unk> appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent .
side effects were insignificant .
effects of <unk> hydrochloride on uterine activity and the cardiovascular system in <unk> patients .
the effects of <unk> hydrochloride were evaluated in 25 <unk> patients in active labor utilizing continuous electronic monitoring of fetal and maternal cardiovascular systems and uterine activity .
fetal scalp blood and free flowing maternal <unk> venous blood was obtained for ph , po2 , pco2 , base deficit and blood glucose determinations prior to and immediately following the study period .
the initial <unk> dose was 50 <unk> for 15 minutes .
the dose was increased by 50 <unk> each 15 minutes until there was a clinically apparent reduction in uterine activity .
once this was accomplished , the infusion was maintained for 30 minutes .
there was a consistent increase in the maternal heart rate ( mhr ) and a significant rise in fetal heart rate ( <unk> ) late in the infusion and in the <unk> period .
there was a widening of the maternal pulse pressure mainly due to a reduction in diastolic pressure with little change in the mean blood pressure .
maternal and fetal ph decreased and base deficit increased during the study although the po2 and pco2 remained unchanged .
maternal and fetal blood glucose rose significantly following <unk> infusion .
treatment of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome by antihistamine .
ovarian hyperstimulation was produced by human menopausal gonadotropin and chorionic gonadotropin in rabbits .
a more rapid regression of the <unk> ovaries was observed in an <unk> group than in a control group .
the difference in regression was found to be statistically significant .
the possibility of treating the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome by antihistamine is cited .
high ph ammonia toxicity , and the search for life on the jovian planets .
jovian plants have <unk> apparently suitable for the evolution of life , but nevertheless , present severe challenges to organisms .
one such challenge arises from the presence of ammonia .
ammonia is an efficient biocide , its effect being dependent on ph as well as on concentration .
the effects of ph and ammonia concentration were studied separately , where possible , on a variety of organisms , including some isolated from natural <unk> of high ph and/or ammonia concentration .
escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis are both extremely sensitive to ammonia .
an aerobic organism ( growth up to ph 11.4 ) from an alkaline spring is more resistant , but exhibits a toxic response to ammonia at a ph much lower than its maximum for growth .
the greatest ammonia resistance has been found in an unidentified organism growing at near neutral ph .
even in this case , however , survival at ammonia concentrations reasonably expected on the jovian planets is measured in hours .
this is , nevertheless , two to three orders of magnitude longer than for e. coli .
our data support the tentative conclusion that contamination of the jovian planets with terrestrial organisms that can grow is unlikely .
however , the range of toxic response noted , coupled with the observation that terrestrial life has not been exposed to high ammonia concentrations for millions of years , suggests that adaptation to greater ammonia tolerance may be possible .

<unk> in the rat liver after <unk> shunt .
<unk> ( <unk> ) activity was studied in livers of rats submitted to an <unk> <unk> shunt ( pcs ) and in developing animals .
to correlate the evolution of the enzymatic activity measured in vitro , <unk> techniques were used to localize enzyme activity in liver tissue .
the <unk> activity in the adult rats was low and amounted to 2.0 <unk> 0.1 <unk> .
during fetal development the enzyme activity rose beginning on the 15th gestational day from 630 <unk> 97 to 1,058 <unk> 20 on the first postnatal day .
then the values declined and reached nearly adult values from the 10th postnatal day .
after pcs the <unk> activity exhibited a <unk> to sixfold increase ( 130 <unk> 69 to 371 <unk> 131 ) as compared with <unk> adult controls ( 53 <unk> 13 ) . the highest levels corresponded to those observed between the 3rd and 5th postnatal day in the developing rats .
the histochemistry of <unk> in the fetal and newborn liver showed a regular distribution of the enzyme as a fine deposit in the hepatocytes throughout the whole tissue .
ten days after birth the activity was low , at the same level as in the adult rat .
in the period after pcs hepatocytes began to show signs of enzymatic activity at the periphery of the hepatic lobules , which subsequently spread through the whole lobules .
the increase of <unk> activity after pcs equaled the activity found in fetal animals .
that correlated well in both groups with the reappearance of histologically demonstrable enzyme activity in hepatocytes .
cardiovascular effects of electrical stimulation of the forebrain in the fetal lamb .
modified <unk> techniques were applied to fetal lambs during the latter third of gestation .
electrical stimulation in the region of the hypothalamus in 10 acute experiments was associated with three patterns of arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes : a <unk> response ; a pure tachycardia response ( abolished by propranolol ) ; and a pure bradycardia response ( abolished by atropine ) .
the <unk> response was examined in detail in 13 chronic preparations ( <unk> days of gestation at operation ) .
the systolic arterial blood pressure increase was never greater than 35 mm hg and was probably blunted by the large <unk> placental circulation .
this pressure increase was abolished by <unk> and was thus mediated by stimulation of <unk> receptors .
the initial tachycardia was prevented by propranolol and was due to beta-adrenergic stimulation .
the tachycardia was followed in a few seconds by a bradycardia , abolished by atropine and possibly a vagal <unk> .
the <unk> response was accentuated in two lambs who were delivered spontaneously and were studied after birth .
these studies indicate that a <unk> neural framework exists in the fetal lamb for influencing the cardiovascular system from as early as 90 days of gestation .
elevated levels of immunoglobulin e in the acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome .
mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome ( <unk> ) is a newly recognized disease characterized by fever persisting for more than 5 days , an erythematous skin eruption , conjunctival congestion , dry red fissured lips , reddened tongue , palms , and soles , <unk> lymphadenopathy , and <unk> diarrhea , arthralgia , and aseptic meningitis .
additional features may include <unk> , pericarditis , <unk> dilation and thrombosis of coronary arteries , and sudden death .
there is a striking similarity of fatal cases to infantile <unk> nodosa , a disease recently reported to be associated with elevated levels of <unk> ige .
indeed , it is likely that <unk> represents a disease which can progress to <unk> nodosa in infants and young children .
the paired acute and convalescent serum ige levels of 20 subjects with acute nonfatal <unk> were studied along with 20 <unk> unaffected controls from the same communities in japan .
the results indicate that most if not all subjects with <unk> in the study had an elevation of total serum ige during the acute phase of the disease ( geometric mean 157 <unk> compared with the control value of 38 <unk> , p = 0.005 ) .
the level appeared to reach a peak 1-2 weeks after onset and declined over the ensuing 1-2 months .
diminished pulmonary lecithin synthesis in acidosis : experimental findings as related to the respiratory distress syndrome .
lung slices from term fetal rats were incubated in vitro at various ph values and the rates of the two de novo pathways for lecithin biosynthesis were determined by measuring the conversion of either <unk> ( pathway 1 ) or <unk> ( pathway 2 ) to the phospholipid .
it was observed that the choline pathway , but not phosphatidylethanolamine methylation , is <unk> with maximum rates occurring at ph levels between 7.3 and 7.5 ; significantly less activity was found at ph levels between 7.0 and 7.2 and at ph levels between 7.6 and 8.0 .
adjustment of the ph from 7.0 to 7.4 in vitro simulating the clinical correction of acidosis by alkali infusion was found to increase the conversion of choline to lecithin to a rate approximating that observed at ph 7.4 .
since <unk> are the principal phospholipid components of pulmonary surfactant , and since pathway 1 is predominantly responsible for lung lecithin synthesis , the demonstration of impaired production with reduced ph offers a biochemical explanation for the pathophysiological effects of acidosis in the respiratory distress syndrome .
a comparison of ph effects on choline pathway rate with the ph profiles of pathway enzymes suggests that these effects are mediated by the catalysts of lecithin synthesis .
ph and bicarbonate excretion in the rat parotid gland as a function of salivary rate .
the bicarbonate concentration in rat parotid saliva increases with increasing flow rates and approximates plasma values at highest salivation .
at lowest flow rates the bicarbonate concentration in the secretory fluid markedly exceeds the plasma levels .
intravenous administration of acetazolamide has no influence on the bicarbonate excretion of the parotid gland .
following retrograde application of acetazolamide into the gland duct the concentrations of both bicarbonate and sodium are elevated .
the potassium concentrations in final saliva exceed 70 meq/l at flow rates below 5 <unk> g gland weight .
with increasing flow rates a precipitous decrease in potassium concentration below 10 meq/l occurs .
with further increase in flow rate the potassium concentration remains unchanged .
the sodium concentrations increased with augmented salivation rate .
at lowest flow rates the sodium concentrations showed an increase of modest degree .
our findings can best be explained by the existence of two independent <unk> mechanism : a ) bicarbonate reabsorption probably in the striated ducts of the parotid gland ; b ) secretion of potassium with <unk> secretion of bicarbonate in the main excretory duct .
<unk> transport and membrane-bound hco - 3 atpase in salivary duct epithelium .
an atpase stimulated by hco - ions and other <unk> and inhibited by <unk> has been found in main excretory duct of rat <unk> gland , a tissue , capable of actively secreting hco - 3 ions .
no such atpase was found in the rabbit duct , which normally does not secrete hco - 3 .
the hco - 3 atpase was localized in the plasma membrane fraction of the <unk> , as evidenced by the marker <unk> .
the activities of the hco - 3 atpase increased in metabolic alkalosis and decreased in metabolic acidosis in parallel to secretion of hco - 3 and <unk> ions by the duct epithelium .
these findings provide further evidence that the membrane-bound hco - 3 atpase is involved in active <unk> - 3 transport .
effects of cyanide and <unk> during hypothermia .
the ventilatory responses , blood gases and acid-base status to intravenous injections of kcn and <unk> hydrochloride were studied in anesthetized dogs during <unk> and at two levels of hypothermia .
in the <unk> animal , kcn evoked significant elevations of minute and alveolar <unk> .
for the mildly hypothermic ( 32-33 degrees c ) dog , minute and alveolar <unk> were proportionally greater than for <unk> .
bolus infusions of kcn to deeply hypothermic dogs ( 28-29 degrees c ) elicited larger and nearly similar increases of minute and alveolar <unk> as compared , respectively , with <unk> and mild hypothermia .
compared to their controls , injections of <unk> during <unk> , mild and deep hypothermia augmented ve 43.3 % , 63.6 % and 31.5 % , respectively .
with <unk> there was a feeble increase in alveolar ventilation .
these results demonstrate that the peripheral ( arterial ) chemoreceptors preserve the capacity to respond to stimuli given acutely while lowering core temperature and in some circumstances this capacity is even enhanced as compared to <unk> .
effects of cyanide and <unk> during panting .
the ventilatory responses , blood gases and acid-base status to intravenous injections of kcn and <unk> hydrochloride were studied in anesthetized dogs during <unk> and thermally induced panting .
in the <unk> animal , kcn evoked elevation of ve ( 154.7 % ) , vt ( 70.1 % ) , f ( 48.3 % , <unk> ( 12.1 % ) and ph ( <unk> units ) , while <unk> diminished by 9.7 mm hg .
during panting , kcn infusions resulted in increases of ve ( 24.5 % ) , vt ( 46.6 % ) , <unk> ( 3.9 % ) and ph ( 0.034 units ) , while f decreased ( 10.1 % ) .
bolus injections of <unk> during <unk> increased ve ( 32.6 % ) , vt ( 18.8 % ) and f ( 17.1 % ) .
during panting ve , vt and f increased by 18.0 % , 18.2 % and 1.5 % , respectively .
these results demonstrate that the peripheral ( arterial ) chemoreceptors preserve the capacity to react to acute chemical stimuli in animals in which the thermal stimuli override the normal chemical control of respiration in order to control body temperature , and that this reaction contributes to the integrated respiratory drive .

combating diabetic ketoacidosis and other <unk> syndromes .
diabetic ketoacidosis is an acute medical emergency that requires immediate diagnosis and treatment .
diagnosis may be established rapidly by measurement of urinary glucose and ketones , arterial blood ph and blood gases , and serum ketones .
rapid infusion of large volumes of fluids and electrolytes , together with continuous infusion of low doses of insulin , provides effective restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance and correction of metabolic derangements .
<unk> <unk> coma is characterized by marked hyperglycemia in the absence of ketoacidosis and occurs usually in patients with mild adult-onset diabetes .
symptoms develop more slowly than in diabetic ketoacidosis .
treatment is the same for both conditions .
in alcoholic ketoacidosis , <unk> is present without hyperglycemia .
the syndrome differs from diabetic ketoacidosis in that blood glucose levels are lower and <unk> is absent .
treatment consists of intravenous administration of dextrose in water and , if necessary , of sodium bicarbonate .
insulin administration usually is not necessary .
[ current conception of the bohr effect ] .
the molecular mechanism of the bohr effect is explained according to the molecular model proposed by perutz et al .
the bohr effect is due to changes in the pk of specific carboxyl and amino groups of the four globin chains following the transition between the <unk> and oxy conformations of the molecule .
carbon dioxide binds to the n terminal valine of the 4 monomers to form <unk> compounds .
this <unk> depends upon ph , pco2 and predominates on deoxygenated haemoglobin .
it is lowered when o2 binds to the heme groups ( o2 linked <unk> compounds ) .
through the <unk> compounds carbon dioxide lowers both the affinity of haemoglobin for o2 and the bohr effect .
<unk> also binds to the <unk> molecule .
this organophosphate lowers the affinity for o2 but increases the bohr effect .
in whole blood , the bohr effect is therefore dependent upon ph , o2 saturation , pco2 and dpg concentration into the red blood cells .
[ study of p50 in patients under continuous o2 inhalation and during chronic respiratory acidosis ] .
in vitro , the affinity of hb for o2 depends on ph and <unk> by the intermediate of the 2-3 dpg level , the concentration of which lowers in the case of acidosis and hypercapnia .
thus , an increase in the affinity results , but while <unk> effect is immediate , on the contrary the 2-3 dpg effect is slow .
authors have verified the importance of this modification by studying the affinity of hb for o2 thanks to the p50 technique in 15 normal non-smokers subjects and in 10 subjects with compensated or not respiratory acidosis but normally saturated thanks to continuous o2 administration .
[ effect of cultivation conditions on the synthesis of citric and <unk> acids in candida <unk> on <unk> medium ] .

[ isolation and study of <unk> of acetobacter <unk> l-1 ] .
[ properties of immobilized trypsin and <unk> and their use for purification of proteinase inhibitors from potatoes ] .

[ effect of different ph values on the activity and quaternary structure of <unk> in escherichia coli extracts ] .
the effect of low ph values on the activity and stability of the quaternary structure of <unk> from escherichia coli was investigated at early stages of purification of the enzyme .
acidification of the e. coli extract was most effective before the biomass separation .
this procedure helped to separate biomass together with coagulated ballast proteins and not to reduce the activity .
upon storage of the acidified solution at 5 degrees c reversible dissociation of the <unk> structure into dimers and monomers occurred .
stability of <unk> in the storage of acetone powders and during extraction was studied .
it is suggested that <unk> in bacterial cells in unlikely to have the quaternary structure which normally occurs in the solution at neutral ph .
[ rhizopus <unk> strain <unk> -- a <unk> producer of lipase ] .
the properties of the <unk> fungus rhizopus <unk> strain <unk> -- producer of <unk> enzymes are described .
optimal cultivation conditions -- 40 degrees , c , ph 4.5 -- are determined .
the <unk> activity of the culture on the medium consisting of corn extract ( 2 % ) , <unk> oil ( 1 % ) and water is 850 ml 0.1 n koh per 100 ml culture liquid .
the <unk> preparations of lipase have been precipitated by isopropanol and ammonium sulphate .
the preparation precipitated by isopropanol shows its <unk> activity at ph 4.2 and 7.8 and a temperature of 40 -- 50 degrees c .
[ preparation of proteolytic enzymes from the <unk> actinomycete actinomyces <unk> <unk> t-54 ] .
a preparation with a high proteolytic activity has been obtained by acetone precipitation from the culture liquid filtrate of the <unk> actinomycete actinomyces <unk> str .
t-54 .
the proteolytic ( <unk> ) , <unk> and thrombolytic activity of the preparation is comparable with that of trypsin and far superior to that of <unk> .
the preparation is stable at ph <unk> and inactivated in the acid zone .
the study of ph dependent proteolytic activity has shown acid , neutral and alkaline proteases in the preparation .
it is relatively <unk> , and is completely inactivated for 10 min at 90 degrees .
it is suggested that the preparation contains four enzymes or four <unk> groups that are different in their temperature sensitivity .
[ analysis of acid proteinases from aspergillus <unk> ] .
the specific action and composition of the functional groups of active centres of three fractions of acid proteinases from aspergillus <unk> have been studied .
with respect to the hydrolysis rates of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> by the three fractions it is suggested that the interaction of acid proteinases with the substrate involves hydrophobic forces .
it has been shown that the above fractions are no metal enzymes .
by means of the <unk> inhibitor an occurrence of a catalytically active carboxy group has been found in the active centre of proteinases .
the proteinase inhibition by <unk> in the presence of citric acid is an indirect evidence of the existence of several carboxy groups and , possibly , of a hydroxy group in the active centre of acid proteinases from aspergillus <unk> .
[ <unk> and <unk> of soluble and <unk> immobilized proteinase from bacillus subtilis ] .
the stability to heating and ph changing of two proteinases of bacillus subtilis was studied .
the preparations were : <unk> <unk> with an activity of <unk> <unk> and proteinase immobilized on <unk> <unk> with an activity of <unk> <unk> .
for <unk> <unk> the ph optimum was <unk> .
for the immobilized preparation <unk> % activity was found at ph <unk> .
the difference between the two proteinase preparations was more distinct with respect to the temperature minimum .
the initial <unk> <unk> was more stable to low temperature and showed maximum activity at 40 degrees ; the immobilized preparation was less active at low temperatures and showed maximum activity at 60-70 degrees .
<unk> <unk> was more sensitive to ph changes , especially in the acid zone ( ph 4.5 ) .
it was significantly activated at 30-40 degrees and was unstable at 50-60 degrees .
the immobilized preparation was activated at <unk> 60 degrees and was insensitive to ph changes in the range of 4.5 to 9.2 and temperature changes from 10 degrees to 40 degrees for <unk> hours .
[ preparation and properties of beta-galactosidase linked covalently with <unk> ] .
fungal beta-galactosidase was immobilized by covalent binding with <unk> .
the resultant preparation contained 3 mg protein per 1 g carrier ; its specific activity was 65 % of the initial one .
as a result of immobilization ph optimum remained unchanged whereas the temperature optimum decreased from 65 degrees to 50 degrees .
the <unk> km of the immobilized enzyme varied insignificantly as compared with km of the soluble enzyme .
[ conditions for splitting <unk> -- the main glycoside from tribulus terrestris l. by the enzymatic preparation from aspergillus niger <unk> ] .
the conditions for splitting <unk> -- the main steroid <unk> isolated from tribulus terrestris l. by the <unk> preparation of aspergillus niger str .
<unk> were investigated .
the optimal conditions were found to be as follows : ph 4-5 , temperature <unk> degrees ( the substrate concentration -- 5 mg % , concentration of the <unk> preparation -- 1 % ) .
under these conditions the <unk> continued 24 hours .
<unk> and <unk> ions accelerated the reaction twice .
as a result of the <unk> hydrolysis <unk> and <unk> were obtained .
this indicates <unk> and <unk> activities of the <unk> complex isolated from aspergillus niger str .
<unk> .
regulation of synthesis of glutamine synthetase by <unk> glutamine synthetase .
we have examined three mutants of klebsiella <unk> whose genetic lesions ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) are in loci unlinked to the structural gene for glutamine <unk> ( <unk> ) and in which the control of both the level and state of <unk> of glutamine synthetase is altered .
each mutation alters a different component of the <unk> system of glutamine synthetase [ l-glutamate : ammonia ligase ( adp-forming ) , ec <unk> ] .
inability of the cell to <unk> glutamine synthetase ( <unk> and <unk> ) greatly decreases its production , while inability to <unk> glutamine <unk> ( <unk> ) results in its constitutively high production .
these results together with our previous results indicate that <unk> glutamine synthetase inhibits the transcription of <unk> .
neuronal properties of hybrid neuroblastoma x sympathetic ganglion cells .
clonal mouse neuroblastoma cells without tyrosine <unk> [ ec <unk> ; tyrosine hydroxylase ; l-tyrosine , <unk> : oxygen oxidoreductase ( <unk> ) ] activity were fused with normal cells from embryonic mouse sympathetic ganglia .
one of the 37 hybrid cell lines obtained possesses high tyrosine <unk> activity and synthesizes dopamine .
these cells also have excitable membranes and generate action potentials in response to electrical stimuli .
thus hybrid cells , generated by fusion of neuroblastoma cells with normal cells from the nervous system , can acquire neural properties not found with the parental neuroblastoma cells .
regulation of <unk> photosynthetic <unk> .
under aerobic conditions that are likely to prevail in chloroplasts in vivo , the optimal concentration of ferredoxin for cyclic <unk> was found to be equal to that required for nadp reduction and about one-tenth of that needed for cyclic <unk> under anaerobic conditions .
in the presence of ferredoxin and nadp , cyclic <unk> operated concurrently with <unk> <unk> , producing an atp : nadph ratio of about 1.5 .
the effective operation of <unk> cyclic <unk> by itself required a curtailment of the electron flow from water which was accomplished experimentally by the use of either an inhibitor or <unk> monochromatic light .
an unexpected discovery was that the operation of cyclic <unk> by itself was also regulated by a back reaction of nadph and ferredoxin with two components of chloroplast membranes , component <unk> and cytochrome <unk> .
the significance of these findings to photosynthesis in vivo is discussed .
high resolution 31p nuclear magnetic resonance studies of intact yeast cells .
high resolution 31p nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectra at 145.7 mhz are presented for intact yeast cells .
several peaks are resolved and assigned .
they include the middle phosphate peaks from long chain or cyclic <unk> .
our results are consistent with the suggestion that these <unk> act as a phosphate store in the cell .
we have also been able to measure cytoplasmic ph using the orthophosphate peak inside the cell , as compared with outside the cell .
the results show that yeast cells maintain their cytoplasmic ph around 6.3 .
this value is considerably higher than the acidic extracellular ph at which they normally live .
these preliminary results indicate that 31p nmr at 145.7 mhz can be a rapid , informative , and non-invasive method for probing biochemical events within living cells .
reversal of udp-galactose <unk> deficiency of human leukocytes in culture .
stimulation with <unk> of the leukocytes from six of the seven known individuals with udp-galactose <unk> ( = udp-glucose <unk> ; ec <unk> ) deficiency consistently resulted in the appearance of epimerase activity in the cultured cells .
a long-term <unk> culture derived from one <unk> also contained an active epimerase enzyme .
a comparison of the properties of this enzyme with those of epimerase produced by control <unk> lines revealed comparable km values for udp-galactose and nad and identical behavior on polyacrylamide electrophoresis .
however , a difference in the nad requirement for heat stability at 40 degree provided some evidence for a structural defect in this enzyme .
possible explanations for the appearance of udp-galactose <unk> activity in stimulated lymphocytes include an increased rate of synthesis of a mutant enzyme and a <unk> of an epimerase locus during lymphocyte transformation .
<unk> , a pre-synaptic toxin with enzymatic activity .
<unk> , a pre-synaptic neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the snake <unk> <unk> , has been shown to modify release of neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction .
in this communication , we demonstrate that <unk> is a potent phospholipase a2 ( <unk> <unk> hydrolase , ec <unk> ) , comparable in activity with purified phospholipase enzymes from naja naja and vipera <unk> .
the phospholipase activity of <unk> requires calcium and is stimulated by <unk> .
when strontium replaces calcium , no phospholipase activity is detected .
since neuromuscular transmission is not blocked when calcium is replaced by strontium , it was possible to examine the effects of the toxin on neuromuscular transmission in the presence of strontium .
under these conditions , when the phospholipase activity should be inhibited , the toxin has little or no effect on neuromuscular transmission .
if <unk> owes its toxicity in part to its enzymatic activity , then it must be placed in a different class from those toxins which produce their effect by binding passively to an appropriate receptor .
isolation and characterization of an unsaturated fatty <unk> mutant of cultured mammalian cells .
an unsaturated fatty <unk> mutant derived from chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells has been isolated and characterized .
this mutant grows normally when <unk> or other unsaturated fatty acids are supplemented in the growth medium .
unlike the wild-type cho cells , growth stops when medium is deprived of unsaturated fatty acid .
whole cell pulse experiments with [ 14c ] acetate or [ 14c ] stearate indicate that the mutant is defective in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis .
enzyme assays in vitro show that the enzymatic defect of the mutant is localized to the microsomal <unk> desaturase .
dna single-strand breaks during repair of uv damage in human fibroblasts and abnormalities of repair in xeroderma pigmentosum .
the method of dna alkaline elution was applied to a study of the formation and resealing of dna single-strand breaks after irradiation of human fibroblasts with ultraviolet light ( uv ) .
the general features of the results were consistent with current concepts of dna excision repair , in that breaks appeared rapidly after uv , and resealed slowly in normal fibroblasts , whereas breaks did not appear in those cells of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum ( xp ) that are known to have defects in dna repair synthesis .
the appearance of breaks required a short <unk> incubation , consistent with the expected action of an endonuclease .
cells of the variant form of xp characterized by normal dna repair synthesis exhibited normal production of breaks after uv , but were slower than normal cells in resealing these breaks .
this difference was enhanced by caffeine .
a model is proposed to relate this finding with a previously described defect in <unk> repair in these xp variant cells .
dna crosslinking appears to cause an underestimate in the measurement of dna breakage after uv .
